When she was 17, she went to boarding school in Lausanne, Switzerland, where she learned to speak French and met girls from all over the world. Upon returning to the U.S., Rebecca developed her love of languages when she earned her B.A. in secondary education, history, French, and Spanish from the University of Utah and did postgraduate work in Arabic.<br /><br />Because of her studies overseas, Rebecca decided to become a teacher and studied French and history at her alma mater in Utah. For the past 15 years, she's taught junior-high and high-school French and history, and says she got into serious writing almost by accident.<br /><br />\"I went through a back door to begin my writing career,\" she says. \"In the first place, I never liked to write anything\u00a0\u2014I only wrote mandatory papers for school. If anyone had told me I would become a writer, let alone love it, I would have laughed and dismissed the notion as absolutely absurd and preposterous.<br /><br />\"Having said that, I did write letters to my parents while I was away at boarding school when I was 17. My mother kept them and one day, after I had become a mother for the second time, she sent me all my old letters and asked me to write my memories from them for posterity. At the time I thought she was insane, but because I adore my mother I did as she asked.<br /><br />\"By the time I\u2019d finished sorting through all those teenage thoughts, observations and opinions, the seeds of a story had begun to form in my mind. The seed eventually became a novel and was published in 1979. It was called <i>The Loving Season,</i> published under the name Rebecca Burton. Naturally, it takes place in Switzerland and France.<br /><br />\"As soon as I finished that novel, I found myself wanting to start another novel entitled <i>By Love Divided,</i> a World War II romance. A few years later, Harlequin bought a novel, <i>Blind to Love,</i> a story that takes place in Kenya. It\u2019s been a love affair ever since.<br /><br />\"I guess the moral of the story is, never underestimate a mother\u2019s intuition!\"<br /><br />As Rebecca has kept writing, her talents have not gone unrecognized. She has won the National Readers' Choice Award, the <i>Romantic Times</i> Reviewers\u2019 Choice Award, and has been named Utah Writer of the Year. Right now, Rebecca is working her way toward her 50th novel for Harlequin.", "influences": null, "works_count": "609", "gender": "female", "hometown": "Salt Lake City", "born_at": "1940/02/14", "died_at": null, "goodreads_author": null, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "6101865"}, "isbn": "0373175671", "isbn13": "9780373175673", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "11"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.ipxfjsq1DUhlPPyKcZHd_g", "title": "The Royal Marriage Arrangement", "title_without_series": "The Royal Marriage Arrangement", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6101865-the-royal-marriage-arrangement", "num_pages": "192", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Harlequin Romance", "publication_day": "10", "publication_year": "2009", "publication_month": "2", "average_rating": "3.62", "ratings_count": "205", "description": "<br /><br />A royal wedding is announced, but this crown prince has made a convenient proposal\u2026<br /><br />The crowd is cheering the royal newlyweds.

He moved to New Orleans in 1939 and changed his name to \"Tennessee,\" the state of his father's birth. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for A Streetcar Named Desire in 1948 and for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1955. In addition, The Glass Menagerie (1945) and The Night of the Iguana (1961) received New York Drama Critics' Circle Awards. His 1952 play The Rose Tattoo (dedicated to his lover, Frank Merlo), received the Tony Award for best play.<br /><br />Characters in his plays are often seen as representations of his family members. Laura Wingfield in The Glass Menagerie was understood to be modeled on Rose. Some biographers believed that the character of Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire is also based on her.<br /><br />Amanda Wingfield in The Glass Menagerie was generally seen to represent Williams' mother, Edwina. Characters such as Tom Wingfield in The Glass Menagerie and Sebastian in Suddenly, Last Summer were understood to represent Williams himself. In addition, he used a lobotomy operation as a motif in Suddenly, Last Summer.<br /><br />The Pulitzer Prize for Drama was awarded to A Streetcar Named Desire in 1948 and to Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1955. These two plays were later filmed, with great success, by noted directors Elia Kazan (Streetcar) with whom Williams developed a very close artistic relationship, and Richard Brooks (Cat). Both plays included references to elements of Williams' life such as homosexuality, mental instability, and alcoholism. Although The Flowering Peach by Clifford Odets was the preferred choice of the Pulitzer Prize jury in 1955 and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof was at first considered the weakest of the five shortlisted nominees, Joseph Pulitzer Jr., chairman of the Board, had seen Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and thought it worthy of the drama prize. The Board went along with him after considerable discussion.[18]<br /><br />Williams wrote The Parade, or Approaching the End of a Summer when he was 29 and worked on it sporadically throughout his life.

He has made it seem true-or at least curiously and suspensefully possible-by the extraordinary skill with which he has wrung detail after detail out of a young woman who has lived with horror. Anne Meacham, as a girl who has been the sole witness to her cousin's unbelievably shocking death, is brought into a 'planned jungle' of a New Orleans garden to confront a family that is intensely interested in having her deny the lurid tale she has told. The post-dilettante's mother is, indeed, so ruthlessly eager to suppress the facts that she had the girl incarcerated in a mental institution and she is perfectly willing, once she finishes her ritualistic five o'clock frozen daiquiri, to order the performance of a frontal lobotomy. A nun stands in rigid attendance; a doctor prepares a hypodermic to force the truth; greedy relatives beg her to recant in return for solid cash. Under the assorted, and thoroughly fascinating, pressures that are brought to bear, and under the intolerable, stammering strain of reliving her own memories, Miss Meacham slowly, painfully, hypnotically paints a concrete and blistering portrait of loneliness.of the sudden snapping of that spider's web that is one man's life, of ultimate panic and futile flight. The very reluctance with which the grim, hopeless narrative is unfolded binds us to it; Mr. Williams threads it out with a spare, sure, sharply vivid control of language.and the spell is cast.\"", "authors": {"author": {"id": "7751", "name": "Tennessee Williams", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1206504901p5/7751.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1206504901p2/7751.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7751.Tennessee_Williams", "average_rating": "3.92", "ratings_count": "425955", "text_reviews_count": "8282"}}, "published": "1990", "work": {"id": "156272", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.lK-iQSa0o4b6-PPMQ1nd8g"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "629931"}, "isbn": "0822208237", "isbn13": "9780822208235", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "93"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.YO4VmevbtUu-bscC-CIMiA", "title": "The Night of the Iguana", "title_without_series": "The Night of the Iguana", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1391639817m/629931.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1391639817s/629931.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/629931.The_Night_of_the_Iguana", "num_pages": null, "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": "Acting Edition", "publisher": "Dramatists Play Service", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "1990", "publication_month": "12", "average_rating": "3.85", "ratings_count": "4374", "description": "At a shabby hotel in Mexico, c 1940, various American tourists, including a defrocked minister and a moody spinster, are unsettled, body and soul, by the bawdy broad who's running the joint.

Unfortunately, he can't seem to stop thinking about Bleu Labeau, a reticent teacher who has come to Toussaint to start a new school in St. Cecil's parish. Bleu suffers the psychological consequences of being the widow of a man who taught her that sex was dirty, wrong and best performed in the dark.Father Cyrus Payne, the priest at St. Cecil's, is busy with his new school project, but still can't keep his assistant Madge Pollard off his mind. He has decided to push her into dating other men. The results only deepen Father Cyrus's struggle to choose between the church and the woman he loves.<br /><br />The new school project has also brought to Toussaint an evil, violent presence.

Fortunately she grew up in Bloomington, Indiana, where few people were aware of the stigma of being a fire horse -- at least until Meg became a teenager, when she flunked freshman Algebra twice, then decided to cut her own bangs. After six years as an undergrad at Indiana University, Meg moved to New York City (in the middle of a sanitation worker strike) to pursue a career as an illustrator, at which she failed miserably, forcing her to turn to her favorite hobby--writing novels--for emotional succor. She worked various jobs to pay the rent, including a decade-long stint as the assistant manager of a 700 bed freshmen dormitory at NYU, a position she still occasionally misses. <br /><br />She is now the author of nearly fifty books for both adults and teens, selling fifteen million copies worldwide, many of which have been #1 New York Times bestsellers, most notably The Princess Diaries series, which is currently being published in over 38 countries, and was made into two hit movies by Disney. In addition, Meg wrote the Mediator and 1-800-Where-R-You? series (on which the television series, Missing, was based), two All-American Girl books, Teen Idol, Avalon High, How to Be Popular, Pants on Fire, Jinx, a series of novels written entirely in email format (Boy Next Door, Boy Meets Girl, and Every Boy's Got One), a mystery series (Size 12 Is Not Fat/ Size 14 Is Not Fat Either/Big Boned), and a chick-lit series called Queen of Babble. <br /><br />Meg is now writing a new children's series called Allie Finkle's Rules for Girls. Her new paranormal series, Abandon, debuts in Summer of 2011. <br /><br />Meg currently divides her time between Key West, Indiana, and New York City with a primary cat (one-eyed Henrietta), various back-up cats, and her husband, who doesn't know he married a fire horse. Please don't tell him. <br /><br /><br /><b>Series:</b><br />* <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/45023-airhead\" rel=\"nofollow\">Airhead</a><br />* <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/43768-the-princess-diaries\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Princess Diaries</a><br />* <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/41667-mediator\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mediator</a><br />", "influences": null, "works_count": "184", "gender": "female", "hometown": "Bloomington, Indiana", "born_at": null, "died_at": null, "goodreads_author": "true", "user": {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "5450664"}}, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "38980"}, "isbn": "0613371658", "isbn13": "9780613371650", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "3850"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.8N82W0I1RGqp-_I8IcJHZQ", "title": "The Princess Diaries (The Princess Diaries, #1)", "title_without_series": "The Princess Diaries", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355011082m/38980.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355011082s/38980.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38980.The_Princess_Diaries", "num_pages": "283", "format": "Library Binding", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Turtleback", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "2001", "publication_month": "7", "average_rating": "3.77", "ratings_count": "215212", "description": "<strong>The first book in the #1 </strong><em>\n  <strong>New York Times </strong>\n</em><strong>bestselling Princess Diaries series by Meg Cabot.</strong><br /><br />Mia Thermopolis is pretty sure there\u2019s nothing worse than being a five-foot-nine, flat-chested freshman, who also happens to be flunking Algebra.

Yet there is great value in asking the question, she says, because the answer to it is found in the asking: It is in the place of not-knowing that arises from asking \"Who is God?\" that words and concepts fall away, that the mystery of what that little three-letter word represents is communicated directly to the heart.\u00a0 <br /><br />In forty-six short meditations, Irma Zaleski reflects on the mystery of God, the vision of faith, and the conversion of the heart that enables us to live in communion with the Ultimate Reality that reason cannot penetrate nor words express.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "290562", "name": "Irma Zaleski", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/290562.Irma_Zaleski", "average_rating": "4.30", "ratings_count": "33", "text_reviews_count": "2"}}, "published": "2006", "work": {"id": "961509", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.7iFvSzPVcqwzh11sKEVnaQ"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "963726"}, "isbn": "1590303032", "isbn13": "9781590303030", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.KBLW49jeBBW88ZTboDaK9Q", "title": "God Is Not Reasonable: And Other Tales of Mother Macrina", "title_without_series": "God Is Not Reasonable: And Other Tales of Mother Macrina", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320520995m/963726.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320520995s/963726.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/963726.God_Is_Not_Reasonable", "num_pages": "128", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "New Seeds", "publication_day": "14", "publication_year": "2006", "publication_month": "2", "average_rating": "3.20", "ratings_count": "5", "description": "\"You can't 'get' to heaven,\" says Mother Macrina, \"you must <i>become</i> heaven,\" and the way that happens is through prayer, repentance, and love.

But, she is not the only one who wants to know who the man is, and soon finds herself in the middle of a deeper investigation and unsure who to trust.<br /><br />The only thing Ridley knows for sure is that she has to get to the truth about herself and her past if she is ever going to find her way home.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "18445", "name": "Lisa Unger", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1526322171p5/18445.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1526322171p2/18445.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18445.Lisa_Unger", "average_rating": "3.71", "ratings_count": "85810", "text_reviews_count": "11416"}}, "published": "2007", "work": {"id": "6473462", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ff0O3vIzM5Gp6fpRzEMzXw"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "17672035"}, "isbn": "0345806077", "isbn13": "9780345806079", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "151"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.-WbRH0vcWhWSRCRqxDFlew", "title": "Heartbroken", "title_without_series": "Heartbroken", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1364312230m/17672035.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1364312230s/17672035.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17672035-heartbroken", "num_pages": "480", "format": "Mass Market Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Vintage Crime/Black Lizard", "publication_day": "25", "publication_year": "2013", "publication_month": "6", "average_rating": "3.55", "ratings_count": "5015", "description": "Kate has written a novel based on a tragic love story from her family's past.

She wrote eighty crime novels and story collections, fourteen plays, and several other books. Her books have sold roughly four billion copies and have been translated into 45 languages. She is the creator of the two most enduring figures in crime literature-Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple-and author of <i>The Mousetrap</i>, the longest-running play in the history of modern theatre. <br /><br />Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller was born in Torquay, Devon, England, U.K., as the youngest of three. The Millers had two other children: Margaret Frary Miller (1879\u20131950), called Madge, who was eleven years Agatha's senior, and Louis Montant Miller (1880\u20131929), called Monty, ten years older than Agatha. <br /><br />During the First World War, she worked at a hospital as a nurse; later working at a hospital pharmacy, a job that influenced her work, as many of the murders in her books are carried out with poison.<br /><br />Her first novel, <i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</i>, came out in 1920. During this marriage, Agatha published six novels, a collection of short stories, and a number of short stories in magazines.<br /><br />In late 1926, Agatha's husband, Archie, revealed that he was in love with another woman, Nancy Neele, and wanted a divorce. On 8 December 1926 the couple quarreled, and Archie Christie left their house Styles in Sunningdale, Berkshire, to spend the weekend with his mistress at Godalming, Surrey. That same evening Agatha disappeared from her home, leaving behind a letter for her secretary saying that she was going to Yorkshire. Her disappearance caused an outcry from the public, many of whom were admirers of her novels. Despite a massive manhunt, she was not found for eleven days.<br /><br />In 1930, Christie married archaeologist Max Mallowan (Sir Max from 1968) after joining him in an archaeological dig. Their marriage was especially happy in the early years and remained so until Christie's death in 1976.<br /><br />Christie frequently used familiar settings for her stories. Christie's travels with Mallowan contributed background to several of her novels set in the Middle East. Other novels (such as <i>And Then There Were None</i>) were set in and around Torquay, where she was born. Christie's 1934 novel <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i> was written in the Hotel Pera Palace in Istanbul, Turkey, the southern terminus of the railway. The hotel maintains Christie's room as a memorial to the author. The Greenway Estate in Devon, acquired by the couple as a summer residence in 1938, is now in the care of the National Trust.<br /><br />Christie often stayed at Abney Hall in Cheshire, which was owned by her brother-in-law, James Watts. She based at least two of her stories on the hall: the short story <i>The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding</i>, which is in the story collection of the same name, and the novel <i>After the Funeral</i>. Abney Hall became Agatha's greatest inspiration for country-house life, with all the servants and grandeur which have been woven into her plots.<br /><br />During the Second World War, Christie worked in the pharmacy at University College Hospital of University College, London, where she acquired a knowledge of poisons that she put to good use in her post-war crime novels. <br /><br />To honour her many literary works, she was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1956 New Year Honours. The next year, she became the President of the Detection Club. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia entry for Agatha Christie</a>", "influences": "<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4624490.Edgar_Allan_Poe\" title=\"Edgar Allan Poe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/60005.Anna_Katherine_Green\" title=\"Anna Katherine Green\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anna Katherine Green</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2448.Sir_Arthur_Conan_Doyle\" title=\"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7014283.G_K__Chesterton\" title=\"G.K.

That the imaginary tears must be wiped away: crying, desperate eyes replaced by the carefree, corner-crinkled eyes of a man who has just been made to laugh by his beloved; or the devoted, follow-you-to-the-grave eyes of a man who has just made love to her. Or to anyone. Or to a plank with a mink-lined hole in it.<br /><br />Oh, yes. Talba was not only under thirty, but well under twenty-five, and already she knew everything about eyes like that\u2014everything except what they meant when they were underscored by velvet-soft pouches so big they needed a bra; so bloodstained, so seemingly bruised you wanted to order emergency ice.<br /><br />When Eddie Valentino spoke again, interrupting her silent ocular love song, she nearly did a double take. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it, Ms. Wallis.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYou\u2019ll think about it? Here I stay up half the night to show you what I can do, and then I get here before sunrise, and you\u2019ll think about it?\u201d<br /><br />And for the first time in the interview, sad, soulful Eddie Valentino really did smile\u2014a broad, amused, gotcha smile. \u201cI thought it only took you ten minutes. Hour and a half at the most.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cI\u2019m making a point, Mr. Valentino. I tend to exaggerate when I\u2019m making a point. And the point is, I\u2019m your hotshot.

I mean, what\u2019s the definition of a hotshot?\u201d<br /><br />He smiled again, \u201cYou\u2019re a ball of fire, all right. I just gotta sleep on it, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cOh.

As she uncovers dark truths, events and people spiral into nasty motion in a story that has more twists and turns than the Mississippi River.<br /></div>", "authors": {"author": {"id": "99237", "name": "Julie Smith", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1236911990p5/99237.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1236911990p2/99237.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/99237.Julie_Smith", "average_rating": "3.77", "ratings_count": "28915", "text_reviews_count": "2224"}}, "published": "2012", "work": {"id": "2669404", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Rs4twK6pm2Z8A3GdYOS7yQ"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "14623349"}, "isbn": {"@nil": "true"}, "isbn13": {"@nil": "true"}, "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "73"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.UD193xMbdGNVT3CuFHyqDQ", "title": "Axeman's Jazz (Skip Langdon, #2)", "title_without_series": "Axeman's Jazz", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1367194948m/14623349.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1367194948s/14623349.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14623349-axeman-s-jazz", "num_pages": "372", "format": "Kindle Edition", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "booksBnimble", "publication_day": "26", "publication_year": "2012", "publication_month": "4", "average_rating": "3.66", "ratings_count": "2061", "description": "What\u2019s the perfect killing field for a murderer? <br /><br />A place where he (or maybe she) can learn your secrets from your own mouth and then make friends over coffee.

Schneider and Orah T. Krug discuss the history, theory, and practice of this distinctly American expression of existential therapy. Existential - humanistic therapy welds the European existential philosophical heritage of self-inquiry, struggle, and responsibility with the American tradition of spontaneity, optimism, and practicality. Contrary to its common reputation as a purely intellectual form of therapy, this approach emphasizes not only the concepts of freedom and responsibility, but experiential reflection, in which clients experience their problems in session through a process of checking in with their affective and bodily sensations. The goal of this therapy is to help clients free themselves from self-imposed limitations and come to a deeper understanding of their authentic life goals, versus those imposed by others or by a rigid sense of self. This approach, which is becoming increasingly integrative, is applicable in a wide array of settings and diagnostic populations and, because of its emphasis on key contextual factors, is increasingly influential on the therapeutic profession as a whole.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "549416", "name": "Kirk J.

It weds faith to doubt, and the depth and pathos of religiousity to the openness and discernment of science.<br /><br />As Schneider says in his introduction: \"The starting point of consciousness is awe. We humans first experience the world (cosmos) as overwhelming. From the moment we are aware, we are aware of our meagerness. From the moment we reflect on the world, we sense how hopeless, helpless, and vulnerable we are. And yet, close on the heels of this shuddering despair is a riveting sense of possibility.<br /><br />\"We are thrilled, enthralled, and exalted by our condition as much as it overpowers us. There are many problems with conventional maxims of balance. The conventional 'center' is a rather dull and static one and not at all what I have in mind with my notion of a 'fluid center'. What, then, do I have in mind, and how are we to cultivate it in this atrophied world? We will explore these questions over a broad range of psychological domains-from personality to psychotherapy and from society to religion and spirituality.\"", "authors": {"author": {"id": "549416", "name": "Kirk J.

The book highlights several notable dimensions: a novel and comprehensive theory of integrative existential practice; a premium on mainstream integrations of existential theory as well as existential-humanistic integrations of mainstream theory; a focus on integrative mainstream as well as existential-humanistic practitioners, students, and theorists; a discussion of short-term and cognitive-behavioral existential-integrative strategies; a focus on ethnic and diagnostic diversity, from case studies of multicultural populations to vignettes on gender, sexuality, and power, and from contributions to the treatment of alcoholism to those elucidating religiosity, psychoses, and intersubjectivity.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "549416", "name": "Kirk J.

This is a movement comprised of people who refuse the \"quick-fix\" model for healing, whether that model entails popping pills, indulging in material comforts, or adhering to doctrinal dogmas. By contrast, the movement about which Schneider writes is composed of people who have developed the capacity to experience the humility and wonder, or in short, awe, of life deeply lived. In particular, this book highlights the stories of people who through the cultivation of awe have transformed their lives. For example, readers will discover how awe transformed the life of an ex-gang member into a beloved and productive gang mediator, an ex-drug addict into a communally conscious healer, and a sufferer of stage three cancer into a contemplative and spiritual seeker. The book will also inform readers about the challenges and joys of awe-based child-raising, education, humor, political activism, and aging.

His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity.<br /><br />Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.<br /><br />Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age. His 1843 novella, <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. <i>Oliver Twist</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i> are also frequently adapted, and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel, <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, set in London and Paris, is his best-known work of historical fiction. Dickens's creative genius has been praised by fellow writers\u2014from Leo Tolstoy to <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3706.George_Orwell\" title=\"George Orwell\" rel=\"nofollow\">George Orwell</a> and G. K. Chesterton\u2014for its realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism. On the other hand, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism. The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.<br /><br />On 8 June 1870, Dickens suffered another stroke at his home after a full day's work on <i>Edwin Drood.</i> He never regained consciousness, and the next day he died at Gad's Hill Place. Contrary to his wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral \"in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner,\" he was laid to rest in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. A printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads: \"To the Memory of Charles Dickens (England's most popular author) who died at his residence, Higham, near Rochester, Kent, 9 June 1870, aged 58 years. He was a sympathiser with the poor, the suffering, and the oppressed; and by his death, one of England's greatest writers is lost to the world.\" His last words were: \"On the ground\", in response to his sister-in-law Georgina's request that he lie down.<br /><br />(from Wikipedia)", "influences": "<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/29951.Thomas_Carlyle\" title=\"Thomas Carlyle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thomas Carlyle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4037220.Miguel_de_Cervantes\" title=\"Miguel de Cervantes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miguel de Cervantes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2007.Daniel_Defoe\" title=\"Daniel Defoe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daniel Defoe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17501.Henry_Fielding\" title=\"Henry Fielding\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henry Fielding</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5878896.Tobias_Smollett\" title=\"Tobias Smollett\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tobias Smollett</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4345.Walter_Scott\" title=\"Walter Scott\" rel=\"nofollow\">Walter Scott</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/228089.Balzac\" title=\"Balzac\" rel=\"nofollow\">Balzac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13661.Victor_Hugo\" title=\"Victor Hugo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Victor Hugo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/65124.Oliver_Goldsmith\" title=\"Oliver Goldsmith\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oliver Goldsmith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6378.Hans_Christian_Andersen\" title=\"Hans Christian Andersen\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hans Christian Andersen</a>", "works_count": "4388", "gender": "male", "hometown": "Portsmouth, England", "born_at": "1812/02/07", "died_at": "1870/06/09", "goodreads_author": null, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1953"}, "isbn": "0141439602", "isbn13": "9780141439600", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "11143"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.bgLTHxV282XgUmsGrYs8hA", "title": "A Tale of Two Cities", "title_without_series": "A Tale of Two Cities", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344922523m/1953.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344922523s/1953.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1953.A_Tale_of_Two_Cities", "num_pages": "489", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": "Penguin, UK / CAN / USA", "publisher": "Penguin", "publication_day": null, "publication_year": "2003", "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "3.83", "ratings_count": "726386", "description": "<b>\n  <i>'Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death; -- the last, much the easiest to bestow, O Guillotine!'</i>\n</b><br /><br />After eighteen years as a political prisoner in the Bastille, the ageing Doctor Manette is finally released and reunited with his daughter in England.

Realizing he didn't have the right stuff for a pro career, he shifted gears and majored in accounting at Mississippi State University. After graduating from law school at Ole Miss in 1981, he went on to practice law for nearly a decade in Southaven, specializing in criminal defense and personal injury litigation. In 1983, he was elected to the state House of Representatives and served until 1990.<br /><br />One day at the DeSoto County courthouse, Grisham overheard the harrowing testimony of a twelve-year-old rape victim and was inspired to start a novel exploring what would have happened if the girl's father had murdered her assailants. Getting up at 5 a.m. every day to get in several hours of writing time before heading off to work, Grisham spent three years on A Time to Kill and finished it in 1987. Initially rejected by many publishers, it was eventually bought by Wynwood Press, who gave it a modest 5,000 copy printing and published it in June 1988.<br /><br />That might have put an end to Grisham's hobby. However, he had already begun his next book, and it would quickly turn that hobby into a new full-time career\u2014and spark one of publishing's greatest success stories. The day after Grisham completed A Time to Kill, he began work on another novel, the story of a hotshot young attorney lured to an apparently perfect law firm that was not what it appeared. When he sold the film rights to The Firm to Paramount Pictures for $600,000, Grisham suddenly became a hot property among publishers, and book rights were bought by Doubleday. Spending 47 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list, The Firm became the bestselling novel of 1991.<br /><br />The successes of The Pelican Brief, which hit number one on the New York Times bestseller list, and The Client, which debuted at number one, confirmed Grisham's reputation as the master of the legal thriller. Grisham's success even renewed interest in A Time to Kill, which was republished in hardcover by Doubleday and then in paperback by Dell. This time around, it was a bestseller.<br /><br />Since first publishing A Time to Kill in 1988, Grisham has written one novel a year (his other books are The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, The Chamber, The Rainmaker, The Runaway Jury, The Partner, The Street Lawyer, The Testament, The Brethren, A Painted House, Skipping Christmas, The Summons, The King of Torts, Bleachers, The Last Juror, and The Broker) and all of them have become international bestsellers. There are currently over 225 million John Grisham books in print worldwide, which have been translated into 29 languages. Nine of his novels have been turned into films (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, A Time to Kill, The Rainmaker, The Chamber, A Painted House, The Runaway Jury, and Skipping Christmas), as was an original screenplay, The Gingerbread Man. The Innocent Man (October 2006) marks his first foray into non-fiction.<br /><br />Grisham lives with his wife Renee and their two children Ty and Shea. The family splits their time between their Victorian home on a farm in Mississippi and a plantation near Charlottesville, VA.<br /><br />Grisham took time off from writing for several months in 1996 to return, after a five-year hiatus, to the courtroom. He was honoring a commitment made before he had retired from the law to become a full-time writer: representing the family of a railroad brakeman killed when he was pinned between two cars. Preparing his case with the same passion and dedication as his books' protagonists, Grisham successfully argued his clients' case, earning them a jur", "influences": "<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3535.William_Faulkner\" title=\"William Faulkner\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Faulkner</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/585.John_Steinbeck\" title=\"John Steinbeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Steinbeck</a>", "works_count": "228", "gender": "male", "hometown": "Jonesboro, Arkansas", "born_at": null, "died_at": null, "goodreads_author": "true", "user": {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "8723181"}}, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "32542"}, "isbn": "0385338600", "isbn13": "9780385338608", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "3935"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.Deje_g0GOu5pkUJiUWpnTA", "title": "A Time to Kill (Jake Brigance, #1)", "title_without_series": "A Time to Kill", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32542.A_Time_to_Kill", "num_pages": "515", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Dell", "publication_day": "15", "publication_year": "2004", "publication_month": "3", "average_rating": "4.05", "ratings_count": "646337", "description": "Before <i>The Firm</i> and <i>The Pelican Brief</i> made him a superstar, John Grisham wrote this riveting story of retribution and justice -- at last it's available in a Doubleday hardcover edition.

Tarpley. Hewey, who \"usually accepted the vagaries of life without getting his underwear in a twist\", is fun-loving and whiskey-drinking.

He convinces Walter to join him on a mission for Tarpley, driving 600 head of cattle from beyond San Antonio to the Double-C ranch on the Pecos.<br />The journey is both memorable and dangerous: a murderous outlaw is searching for Hewey; and another ruthless character is determined to sabotage the cattle drive.

Johnston was born January 1, 1947 in Arkansas City, KS. <br /> Nineteen publishers rejected Johnston's first novel, Carry the Wind, before it was printed in 1982. However, this first novel was to gain the honor of receiving the Western Writers of America Medicine Pipe Bearer's Award for best first fiction. Johnston is known for his eye for historical detail, and he is a stickler for accuracy. He is known for traveling and exploring down known and unknown dusty roads during the hot summer months, and traversing slippery, muddy roads and hiking through snow to stand upon a historical sight that he would tell his readers in an upcoming book. \"Parking in the lower lot, I trudged up the hill to reach the spot where Colonel John Gibbon's infantry waited out the last hours before their attack on the unsuspecting camp. Standing there in the icy snowstorm I was totally overwhelmed by the sight of those skeletal cones of lodgepoles standing stark against the low, gray sky . . .\" Some of the sites that he would stand upon were known to the world like the Little Big Horn Battlefield and others would be obscure to the average reader like the Weippe Prairie north of Lochsa. He is known to combine \"a roaring good tale with fascinating insights into the lives and times of his principal characters, generally managing to employ his extensive knowledge to enhance a story rather than intrude upon it\" (Whitehead, 1991). Johnston would say that he considered himself \"not a literary writer but a storyteller.\" His desire was to reach and teach thousands if not millions of readers about the early western frontier. <br /><br /> He accomplished part of this goal, not only through his books, but through discussions given to elementary children, lectures at symposiums, and historical one-week tours \"during which you will re-live the grit and blood, the tears and tragedy of the great Indian Wars.\" He would blend historical fact with human emotion to re-create the past during his historical tours each summer. One presentation he gave to a fourth grade class was about the Plains Indian culture. He held a discussion with a Honors English class in Castle Rock middle school about \"research, writing, and editing that goes into producing two historical novels each year, when compared to their \"term papers.\" He gave keynote speeches at seminars and lectures at symposiums. He traveled all around Montana to sign books for fans, and he signed the books at the local Albertson's in each town. He held radio interviews that \"took me into cities, talking before audiences, I never would have managed to reach otherwise.\" <br /><br />", "influences": null, "works_count": "40", "gender": "male", "hometown": "Arkansas City, KS", "born_at": "1947/01/01", "died_at": "2001/03/01", "goodreads_author": null, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "202130"}, "isbn": "055325572X", "isbn13": "9780553255720", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "15"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.-Eke6zpW3bOIU1atOpGM1g", "title": "Carry the Wind", "title_without_series": "Carry the Wind", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202130.Carry_the_Wind", "num_pages": "704", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Domain", "publication_day": "16", "publication_year": "1997", "publication_month": "1", "average_rating": "4.33", "ratings_count": "291", "description": "Young Josiah Paddock, on the run from his past in St. Louis, didn't have much hope of survival.\u00a0\u00a0Winter was coming to the Rockies, and if the cold cutting through his city clothes didn't kill him, grizzlies or Indians would.\u00a0\u00a0Then his luck tumed.\u00a0\u00a0He stumbled across the trail of Ol' Scratch, a solitary mountain man eager enough for company to take the brash youngster under his wing.\u00a0\u00a0Pure chance brought Paddock to the old trapper's camp, but it was skill with a gun and a knife that kept them both alive as they rode deep into the majestic land of Blackfeet and Crow, bible-spouting pioneers and sensual woman where only the best and braves survived . . . and only the luckiest rode back again. <i>Carry The Wind</i> is a gripping historical saga set in the Grand Tetons during a time when the horizon never ended and a nation was being born.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "8022", "name": "Terry C.

King therefore wanted to write under another name, in order to increase his publication without over-saturating the market for the King \"brand\". He convinced his publisher, Signet Books, to print these novels under a pseudonym.<br /><br />In his introduction to <i>The Bachman Books</i>, King states that adopting the nom de plume Bachman was also an attempt to make sense out of his career and try to answer the question of whether his success was due to talent or luck. He says he deliberately released the Bachman novels with as little marketing presence as possible and did his best to \"load the dice against\" Bachman. King concludes that he has yet to find an answer to the \"talent versus luck\" question, as he felt he was outed as Bachman too early to know. The Bachman book <i>Thinner</i> (1984) sold 28,000 copies during its initial run\u2014and then ten times as many when it was revealed that Bachman was, in fact, King.<br /><br />The pseudonym King originally selected (Gus Pillsbury) is King's maternal grandfather's name, but at the last moment King changed it to Richard Bachman. Richard is a tribute to crime author Donald E. Westlake's long-running pseudonym Richard Stark. (The surname Stark was later used in King's novel <i>The Dark Half</i>, in which an author's malevolent pseudonym, \"George Stark\", comes to life.) Bachman was inspired by Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive, a rock and roll band King was listening to at the time his publisher asked him to choose a pseudonym on the spot.<br /><br />King provided biographical details for Bachman, initially in the \"about the author\" blurbs in the early novels. Known \"facts\" about Bachman were that he was born in New York, served a four-year stint in the Coast Guard, which he then followed with ten years in the merchant marine. Bachman finally settled down in rural central New Hampshire, where he ran a medium-sized dairy farm, writing at night. His fifth novel was dedicated to his wife, Claudia Inez Bachman, who also received credit for the bogus author photo on the book jacket. Other \"facts\" about the author were revealed in publicity dispatches from Bachman's publishers: the Bachmans had one child, a boy, who died in an unfortunate, Stephen King-ish type accident at the age of six, when he fell through a well and drowned. In 1982, a brain tumour was discovered near the base of Bachman's brain; tricky surgery removed it. After Bachman's true identity was revealed, later publicity dispatches (and about the author blurbs) revealed that Bachman died suddenly in late 1985 of \"cancer of the pseudonym, a rare form of schizonomia\".<br /><br />King dedicated Bachman's early books\u2014<i>Rage (1977), The Long Walk (1979), Roadwork (1981)</i>, and <i>The Running Man</i> (1982)\u2014to people close to him. The link between King and his shadow writer was exposed after a Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, noted similarities between the writing styles of King and Bachman. Brown located publisher's records at the Library of Congress which included a document naming King as the author of one of Bachman's novels. Brown wrote to King's publishers with a copy of the documents he had uncovered, and asked them what to do. Two weeks later, King telephoned Brown personally and suggested he write an article about how he discovered the truth, allowing himself to be interviewed. King has taken full ownership of the Bachman name on numerous occasions, as with the republication of the first four Bachman titles as <i> The Bachman Books: Four Early Novels by Stephen King</i> in 1985.

But this passionate individualist turned her back on upper-class privilege and created a life wholly her own. In 1935, Sunday and her husband John Reed bought Heide, a modest weatherboard house in rural Heidelberg. Heide was not only a home but the focal point for the development of Australian modernism. Until their deaths in the early eighties, the Reeds lived there and cultivated Australia's most significant circle of artists, including Sidney Nolan, Albert Tucker, John Perceval, Joy Hester and Charles Blackman.<br /><br />In the words of Albert Tucker, Sunday was 'the magnetic force that drew us together, the eye...' While Sunday was a muse to several generations of Australian artists, Sidney Nolan remained her lifelong obsession. Gifted, charismatic and visionary, Nolan was mesmerised by Sunday - and she by him. They were lovers for several tempestuous years. But Sunday was more than Nolan's muse. Award winning biographer Janine Burke argues that she was crucial to his artistic development - preparing his painting materials, inspiring subject matter and perhaps guiding his hand while he painted the Ned Kelly series, executed on Heide's dining room table. Sunday was a demanding and intense woman, known as much for her irascibility as for her generosity. In this compelling biography, The Heart Garden, Burke draws a rich portrait of this complex and brilliant woman who fuelled the fire of Australian modernism, and was at its heart.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "243015", "name": "Janine Burke", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/f_200x266-3061b784cc8e7f021c6430c9aba94587.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/f_50x66-6a03a5c12233c941481992b82eea8d23.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/243015.Janine_Burke", "average_rating": "3.64", "ratings_count": "296", "text_reviews_count": "39"}}, "published": "2004", "work": {"id": "2381415", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.R0XUapx3MP3C1lzITxYdcw"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "15700343"}, "isbn": "1742378293", "isbn13": "9781742378299", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "6"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.BLEd8kWIbqZ3BCWei3cwtQ", "title": "Nest: The Art of Birds", "title_without_series": "Nest: The Art of Birds", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1349155305m/15700343.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1349155305s/15700343.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15700343-nest", "num_pages": "192", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Allen & Unwin", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "2013", "publication_month": "3", "average_rating": "3.48", "ratings_count": "42", "description": "<b>Part natural history, part folklore, part exploration of art and aesthetics, part memoir, a beautiful book that will appeal to bird lovers, readers of literature, and art lovers</b><br /><br />As an amateur naturalist and nature lover, Janine Burke, art historian and author, has spent many years observing birds.

The artistic process itself is a journey, a specific one, the return to a lost and cherished childhood realm, the original source of inspiration and identity.<br />For the artists and writers in this book - Claude Monet, Virginia Woolf, Vanessa Bell, Karen Blixen, Ernest Hemingway, Georgia O'Keeffe, Jackson Pollock, Pablo Picasso and Emily Kame Kngwarreye - the act of re-creating Eden was a life-changing, art-making, healing rite that becomes both a map of their careers and an index of their subject matter. <br />What unites these artists and writers is a journey of return, of rediscovery, that leads them to the creation of a personal paradise. Upon arriving at that place, whether it was Georgia O'Keeffe in New Mexico, Monet in Giverny or Picasso in Provence, iconic new work emerged, inspired by that terrain, from its light, its colours, its landscape. Each of these artists had recovered the place they'd been unconsciously seeking for years. <br />In this engaging and ground-breaking book, acclaimed biographer and art historian Janine Burke explores how art and landscape, love and companionship, home and garden are entwined. Nature is culture, and its most insistent inspiration.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "243015", "name": "Janine Burke", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/f_200x266-3061b784cc8e7f021c6430c9aba94587.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/f_50x66-6a03a5c12233c941481992b82eea8d23.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/243015.Janine_Burke", "average_rating": "3.64", "ratings_count": "296", "text_reviews_count": "39"}}, "published": "2009", "work": {"id": "17162010", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.swF0zGfXjgAPbLL_gmlAkg"}}]}}}}, "1164105": {"GoodreadsResponse": {"Request": {"authentication": "true", "key": "9ri8jiLcNvV2GMvk5HVidg", "method": "author_show"}, "author": {"id": "1164105", "name": "Kevin Emerson", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1164105.Kevin_Emerson", "fans_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "318"}, "author_followers_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "318"}, "large_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1507144894p7/1164105.jpg", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1507144894p5/1164105.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1507144894p2/1164105.jpg", "about": "Author of sixteen novels for children and young adults, most recently LAST DAY ON MARS, BREAKOUT, and the ATLANTEANS series.

If Haley and Dodger don't act quickly, more people may go missing, and the world as we know it may change for the worse.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "1164105", "name": "Kevin Emerson", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1507144894p5/1164105.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1507144894p2/1164105.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1164105.Kevin_Emerson", "average_rating": "3.75", "ratings_count": "9135", "text_reviews_count": "1493"}}, "published": "2013", "work": {"id": "21548224", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.FR7pbqAYHktqJZww31UzlQ"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "4021756"}, "isbn": "054505804X", "isbn13": "9780545058049", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "12"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.cjq6btkmL7eXyKOI36XjOw", "title": "The Demon Hunter (Oliver Nocturne, #4)", "title_without_series": "The Demon Hunter", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328838371m/4021756.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328838371s/4021756.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4021756-the-demon-hunter", "num_pages": "224", "format": "Mass Market Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Scholastic Paperbacks", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "2009", "publication_month": "2", "average_rating": "4.13", "ratings_count": "218", "description": "A series of gruesome animal/vampire attacks on humans threatens to undermine the vampires' secretive existence.

Condemned by the gods to live eternity without emotions, Arik can only feel when he's in the dreams of others. For thousands of years, he's drifted through the human unconscious, searching for sensation. Now he's finally found a dreamer whose vivid mind can fill his emptiness.<br /><br />Dr. Megeara Kafieri watched her father ruin himself and his reputation as he searched to prove Atlantis was real. Her deathbed promise to him to salvage his reputation has now brought her to Greece where she intends to prove once and for all that the fabled island is right where her father said it was. But frustration and bad luck dog her every step. Especially the day they find a stranger floating in the sea. His is a face she's seen many times.... in her dreams. <br /><br />What she doesn't know is that Arik holds more than the ancient secrets that can help her find the mythical isle of Atlantis. He has made a pact with the god Hades: In exchange for two weeks as a mortal man, he must return to Olympus with a human soul. Megeara's soul. <br /><br />With a secret society out to ruin her expedition, and mysterious accidents that keep threatening her life, Megeara refuses to quit. She knows she's getting closer to Atlantis and as she does, she stumbles onto the truth of what Arik really is.<br /><br />For Arik his quest is no longer simple.

Through nuanced and innovative readings of canonical works by Freud, Nietzsche, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Walter Pater, A. C. Swinburne, and George Eliot, Thomas Albrecht demonstrates the twofold nature of these writers' images of horror. On the one hand, the analysis illuminates how the representation of something seen as horrifying--for instance, a disturbing work of art, an existential insight, or a recognition of the fundamental inaccessibility of another person's consciousness--can serve a protective purpose, to defend the writer in some way against the horror he or she encounters. On the other hand, the representations themselves can be a potential threat--epistemologically unreliable, for instance, or illusory, deceptive, fundamentally unstable, and potentially dangerous to the writers. Through a psychoanalytically informed literary analysis, The Medusa Effect explores crucial ethical and epistemological questions of Victorian aesthetics, as well as underexamined complexities of the mechanisms of Victorian literary representation.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "1168316", "name": "Thomas Albrecht", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1168316.Thomas_Albrecht", "average_rating": "4.00", "ratings_count": "5", "text_reviews_count": "0"}}, "published": "2009", "work": {"id": "13838787", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.RPHfZhxh3Rpveo7nNnZwEg"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "42866013"}, "isbn": {"@nil": "true"}, "isbn13": {"@nil": "true"}, "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.9zzGk-5qmN0ljC9f09xhog", "title": "Passives Einkommen: 6 konkrete M\u00f6glichkeiten zu finanzieller Freiheit", "title_without_series": "Passives Einkommen: 6 konkrete M\u00f6glichkeiten zu finanzieller Freiheit", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42866013-passives-einkommen", "num_pages": null, "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "1168316", "name": "Thomas Albrecht", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1168316.Thomas_Albrecht", "average_rating": "4.00", "ratings_count": "5", "text_reviews_count": "0"}}, "published": null, "work": {"id": "66649732", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.JIPp3s10Kv-UADBaxrkn7A"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "20720506"}, "isbn": "3838663446", "isbn13": "9783838663449", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.Qth2ir-ahI4RIFezbc9h9A", "title": "Optimierungspotentiale Der Personalplanung Durch Das Instrument Der Altersteilzeit Anhand Von Praxisbeispielen", "title_without_series": "Optimierungspotentiale Der Personalplanung Durch Das Instrument Der Altersteilzeit Anhand Von Praxisbeispielen", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1499761330m/20720506.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1499761330s/20720506.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20720506-optimierungspotentiale-der-personalplanung-durch-das-instrument-der-alte", "num_pages": "80", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Diplom.de", "publication_day": "23", "publication_year": "2003", "publication_month": "1", "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": "Inhaltsangabe: Einleitung: Unter dem Druck eines fur das wirtschaftliche Wachstum notwendigen Strukturwandels und angesichts anhaltend hoher und weiterhin steigender Arbeitslosigkeit wird seit zwei Jahrzehnten das vorzeitige Ausscheiden alterer Arbeitnehmer aus dem Erwerbsleben gefordert. Es galt lange Zeit als sozialvertraglich, die Arbeitsplatzchancen junger Menschen zu sichern, indem den Alteren der vorzeitige Ruhestand ohne nennenswerte finanzielle Abschlage ermoglicht wurde. Ob dies ohne Alternative war, mag ruckblickend mit einem Fragezeichen versehen werden. Der Gesetzgeber, die Gewerkschaften und auch die Unternehmen haben dies gemeinsam so gesehen und ihr Handeln daran ausgerichtet. Da diese Praxis nicht mehr finanzierbar war, wurde auch aus diesem Grund das Altersteilzeitgesetz am 23.07.1996 (BGBl. I S. 1078) erlassen, zuletzt geandert durch Artikel 1 des Gesetzes vom 27.06.2000 (BGBl. I S. 910). Es ist gultig bis zum 31.12.2009. Mit dem Altersteilzeitgesetz hat der Gesetzgeber mit Wirkung zum 01.08.1996 eine weitere Form der Teilzeitarbeit geschaffen, die alteren Arbeitnehmern einen gleitenden Ubergang in den Ruhestand ermoglichen soll. Schliessen Arbeitgeber und Arbeitnehmer einen Altersteilzeitvertrag ab, wird dies durch Leistungen der Bundesanstalt fur Arbeit gefordert, wenn die Arbeitszeit ab Vollendung des 55. Lebensjahres spatestens ab 31.12.2009 vermindert und damit die Einstellung eines sonst arbeitslosen Arbeitnehmers ermoglicht wird (vgl. 1 AtG). Die bisherige sozialrechtliche Problematik, wonach die Versicherungs- und Beitragspflicht in den Sozialversicherungen von der Arbeitsleistung gegen Entgelt abhangig war, ist durch die Neuregelung des 7 SGB IV behoben. Insbesondere bei langeren Freistellungsphasen, wie sie im Altersteilzeitarbeitsvertrag vereinbart werden konnen, entstanden Schwierigkeiten im Hinblick auf die Falligkeit und die Verteilung der Beitrage zur Sozialversicherung und bei vorzeitiger Beendigung mit Arbeitszeituberhang. 7 Ab\"", "authors": {"author": {"id": "1168316", "name": "Thomas Albrecht", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1168316.Thomas_Albrecht", "average_rating": "4.00", "ratings_count": "5", "text_reviews_count": "0"}}, "published": "2003", "work": {"id": "40044105", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.975LjgfEGUFQ0c2ofhedGA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "17077848"}, "isbn": "8847003571", "isbn13": "9788847003576", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.tyLBEnHwyI1lxQd8P7-n6g", "title": "Contrastenhanced Ultrasound in Clinical Practice", "title_without_series": "Contrastenhanced Ultrasound in Clinical Practice", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17077848-contrastenhanced-ultrasound-in-clinical-practice", "num_pages": null, "format": "ebook", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Springerverlag Italia", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "2005", "publication_month": "1", "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": "The value of ultrasound contrast agents (USCA) in everyday clinical practice depends on the pharmacokinetics, the signal processing, and the contrast-specific imaging modalities. Second-generation USCA, are blood pool agents that do not leak into the organ tissue to be examined but remain in the intravascular compartment increasing the Doppler signal amplitude during their dynamic vascular phase. Taking advantage of the stability of their microbubbles, they can withstand the acoustic pressure of insonation much better than first-generation contrast media, which results in an increased half-life of the agent and, consequently, in a prolonged diagnostic window. Concomitant with the improvement of contrast agents, different contrast-specific imaging modalities have been developed which, used in combination with USCA and a low mechanical index, allow continuous real-time grey-scale imaging. These recent technical improvements have opened new possibilities in the use of USCA in a variety of indications. Written by internationally renowned experts, the contributions gathered in this book give an overview of current and possible future new applications of USCA in routine and clinical practice.",

P. Lovecraft, there is nothing bigger than the annual Providence-based convention the Summer Tentacular. Horror writer Colleen Danzig doesn\u2019t know what to expect when she arrives, but is unsettled to find that among the hob-knobbing between scholars and literary critics are a group of real freaks: book collectors looking for volumes bound in human skin, and true believers claiming the power to summon the Elder God Cthulhu, one of their idol\u2019s most horrific fictional creations, before the weekend is out.<br /><br />Colleen\u2019s trip spirals into a nightmare when her roommate for the weekend, an obnoxious novelist known as Panossian, turns up dead, his face neatly removed. What\u2019s more unsettling is that, in the aftermath of the murder, there is little concern among the convention goers. The Summer Tentacular continues uninterrupted, except by a few bumbling police.<br /><br />Everyone at the convention is a possible suspect, but only Colleen seems to show any interest in solving the murder. So she delves deep into the darkness, where occult truths have been lurking since the beginning of time.

This book is about survival: how to generate ideas when you needed them yesterday, dialogue and plot on the quick, and what your manuscript is up against in the slush piles of the world. For non-fiction writers, Starve Better offers writing techniques such as how to get (relatively) high-paying assignments in second and third-tier magazines, how to react to your first commissioned assignment, and how to find gigs that pay NOW as the final notices pile up and the mice eat the last of the pasta in the cupboard. Humor, essays and some of the most widely read blog pieces from Nick Mamatas, author and editor of fiction that has caught the attention of speculative fiction's most prestigious awards, come together for the first time in a writers' guide that won't teach anyone how to get rich and famous... but will impart the most valuable skill in the business: how to starve better.<br /><br />Blurb: <br /> \"Mamatas offers up a no-nonsense guide that should be required reading for all writers.

While not every title we publish becomes a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, a national bestseller, or a Hugo or Nebula award-winner, we are committed to publishing quality books from a diverse group of authors.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "193861", "name": "Nick Mamatas", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1380393331p5/193861.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1380393331p2/193861.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/193861.Nick_Mamatas", "average_rating": "3.81", "ratings_count": "15868", "text_reviews_count": "1993"}}, "published": "2016", "work": {"id": "40919981", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.iqtz2_mxqScHLduUA4c8QQ"}}]}}}}, "6001": {"GoodreadsResponse": {"Request": {"authentication": "true", "key": "9ri8jiLcNvV2GMvk5HVidg", "method": "author_show"}, "author": {"id": "6001", "name": "Carolyn Keene", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6001.Carolyn_Keene", "fans_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "2134"}, "author_followers_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "2134"}, "large_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_333x500-46491541e26dbeac15f51487d68dd207.png", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png", "about": "Carolyn Keene is a writer pen name that was used by many different people- both men and women- over the years. The company that was the creator of the Nancy Drew series, the Stratemeyer Syndicate, hired a variety of writers. For Nancy Drew, the writers used the pseudonym Carolyn Keene to assure anonymity of the creator.<br /><br />Edna and Harriet Stratemeyer inherited the company from their father Edward Stratemeyer. Edna contributed 10 plot outlines before passing the reins to her sister Harriet. It was <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5415434.Mildred_Benson\" title=\"Mildred Benson\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mildred Benson</a> (aka: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4556721.Mildred_A__Wirt\" title=\"Mildred A. Wirt\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mildred A. Wirt</a>), who breathed such a feisty spirit into Nancy's character. Mildred wrote 23 of the original 30 Nancy Drew Mystery Stories\u00ae, including the first three. It was her characterization that helped make Nancy an instant hit. The Stratemeyer Syndicate's devotion to the series over the years under the reins of Harriet Stratemeyer Adams helped to keep the series alive and on store shelves for each succeeding generation of girls and boys. In 1959, Harriet, along with several writers, began a 25-year project to revise the earlier Carolyn Keene novels. The Nancy Drew books were condensed, racial stereotypes were removed, and the language was updated. In a few cases, outdated plots were completely rewritten.<br /><br />Other writers of Nancy Drew volumes include Harriet herself, she wrote most of the series after Mildred quit writing for the Syndicate and in 1959 began a revision of the first 34 texts. The role of the writer of \"Carolyn Keene\" passed temporarily to Walter Karig who wrote three novels during the Great Depression. Also contributing to Nancy Drew's prolific existence were Leslie McFarlane, James Duncan Lawrence, Nancy Axelrod, Priscilla Doll, Charles Strong, Alma Sasse, Wilhelmina Rankin, George Waller Jr., and Margaret Scherf.", "influences": null, "works_count": "864", "gender": null, "hometown": null, "born_at": null, "died_at": null, "goodreads_author": null, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "32979"}, "isbn": "1557091552", "isbn13": "9781557091550", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1791"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.4ogLVAnM65I2qHvYQdLdiA", "title": "The Secret of the Old Clock (Nancy Drew Mystery Stories, #1)", "title_without_series": "The Secret of the Old Clock", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1351534678m/32979.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1351534678s/32979.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32979.The_Secret_of_the_Old_Clock", "num_pages": "210", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Applewood Books", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "1991", "publication_month": "9", "average_rating": "3.99", "ratings_count": "54508", "description": "This is a facsimile reprint of the first ever Nancy Drew book, published 1930.<br /><br />Nancy Drew's keen mind is tested when she searches for Mr. Crowley's missing will.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "6001", "name": "Carolyn Keene", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6001.Carolyn_Keene", "average_rating": "3.91", "ratings_count": "568812", "text_reviews_count": "17217"}}, "published": "1991", "work": {"id": "151480", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.2ayaIlNZTI2BeuG3NOxNyA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "233637"}, "isbn": "0448095025", "isbn13": "9780448095028", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1170"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.Ro1mnoevsCNWanLcFebCtg", "title": "The Hidden Staircase (Nancy Drew Mystery Stories, #2)", "title_without_series": "The Hidden Staircase", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1172964121m/233637.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1172964121s/233637.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233637.The_Hidden_Staircase", "num_pages": "182", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Grosset  and Dunlap", "publication_day": null, "publication_year": "1959", "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "3.95", "ratings_count": "27938", "description": "After receiving a call from her friend Helen Corning, Nancy agrees to help solve a baffling mystery.

It was written at the end of the fifth century BCE in Athens, in the final years of the \"Golden Age\" of Athenian culture, and in the last year of Sophocles' own life. At the center of the play is the mysterious transformation of Oedipus from an old and blind beggar, totally dependent on his daughters, to the man who rises from his seat and, without help, leads everyone to the place where he is destined to die. In the background of this transformation stands the grove of the Furies, the sacred place of the implacable goddesses who pursue the violators of blood relationships. Although Oedipus, who killed his father and married his mother, is an obvious target of the Furies' vengeance, he enters their grove at the beginning of the play, sure that it is the resting place Apollo has predicted for him. The reversals and paradoxes in the play speak to the struggle that Oedipus' life and the action of the play bring vividly before us: how do we as humans, subject to constant change, find stable ground on which to stand and define our moral lives? Sophocles offers his play as a witness to the remarkable human capacity to persevere in this struggle.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "1002", "name": "Sophocles", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1195014481p5/1002.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1195014481p2/1002.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1002.Sophocles", "average_rating": "3.76", "ratings_count": "348914", "text_reviews_count": "8038"}}, "published": "2004", "work": {"id": "143129", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.TS-d3lXjECsNYyyMaKdH0Q"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "205196"}, "isbn": "1854597566", "isbn13": "9781854597564", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "97"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.560BWD7Hbuy4kma8qRFguw", "title": "Electra", "title_without_series": "Electra", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328704297m/205196.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328704297s/205196.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205196.Electra", "num_pages": "128", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Nick Hern Books", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "publication_month": "9", "average_rating": "3.81", "ratings_count": "7241", "description": "The Drama Classic edition of Sophocles' version of the Electra myth.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "1002", "name": "Sophocles", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1195014481p5/1002.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1195014481p2/1002.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1002.Sophocles", "average_rating": "3.76", "ratings_count": "348914", "text_reviews_count": "8038"}}, "published": "2004", "work": {"id": "2081212", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.FmLPlGmwWffwavkXbJu96g"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1536"}, "isbn": "0226307867", "isbn13": "9780226307862", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "34"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.qSbGohpeec3dO1a8xdb89g", "title": "Sophocles II: Ajax/Women of Trachis/Electra/Philoctetes (Complete Greek Tragedies 4)", "title_without_series": "Sophocles II: Ajax/Women of Trachis/Electra/Philoctetes (Complete Greek Tragedies 4)", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1536.Sophocles_II", "num_pages": "254", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "University of Chicago Press", "publication_day": "15", "publication_year": "1969", "publication_month": "5", "average_rating": "4.13", "ratings_count": "5394", "description": "Sophocles' innovative plays transformed Greek myths into dramas featuring complex human characters, through which he explored profound moral issues.

The popular image of the men who made the bomb is of dispassionate intellects who number-crunched their way towards a weapon whose devastating power they could not even imagine. But in his Tony Award-winning play Copenhagen, Michael Frayn shows us that these men were passionate, philosophical, and all too human, even though one of the three historical figures in his drama, Werner Heisenberg, was the head of the Nazis' effort to develop a nuclear weapon. The play's other two characters, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr and his wife, Margrethe, are involved with Heisenberg in an after-death analysis of an actual meeting that has long puzzled historians. In 1941, the German scientist visited Bohr, his old mentor and long-time friend, in Copenhagen. After a brief discussion in the Bohrs' home, the two men went for a short walk. What they discussed on that walk, and its implications for both scientists, have long been a mystery, even though both scientists gave (conflicting) accounts in later years. Frayn's cunning conceit is to use the scientific underpinnings of atomic physics, from Schr?dinger's famous cat to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, to explore how an individual's point of view renders attempts to discover the ultimate truth of any human interaction fundamentally impossible. To Margrethe, Heisenberg was always an untrustworthy student, eager to steal from her husband's knowledge. To Bohr, Heisenberg was a brilliant if irresponsible foster son, whose lack of moral compass was part of his genius.

Miller was often in the public eye, most famously for refusing to give evidence against others to the House Un-American Activities Committee, being the recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama among other awards, and for marrying Marilyn Monroe.

Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.<br /><br />Written in 1953, <i>The Crucible</i> is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's \"witch-hunts\" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing, \"Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior.

"description": "This early work by Caroline Spurgeon was originally published in the early 20th century and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography. 'Mysticism in English Literature' is a work of literary criticism on the history of the various types of mystical thought found in literature. Caroline Spurgeon was born on 24 October 1869, in India. She was educated at Cheltenham Ladies College, England and at King's College, London and also University College London. Spurgeon went on to become an esteemed literary critic, and was actually the first female professor of English literature. From 1900 onwards she lectured on the subject and was only the second female professor in England at the time. Through her various professional activities inside her own department, she participated in the academic literary-critical renaissance of the twenties and early thirties. She was an active militant in favour of women's eligibility to academic degrees and also advocated for more opportunities for foreign women to study in British Universities.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "393936", "name": "Caroline Frances Eleanor Spurgeon", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/f_200x266-3061b784cc8e7f021c6430c9aba94587.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/f_50x66-6a03a5c12233c941481992b82eea8d23.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/393936.Caroline_Frances_Eleanor_Spurgeon", "average_rating": "3.97", "ratings_count": "71", "text_reviews_count": "9"}}, "published": "2013", "work": {"id": "24865845", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.7dGKV9x9UdrWBK7npfXv8Q"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "3205951"}, "isbn": "0846202794", "isbn13": "9780846202790", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.siY-BFI8XDHfn4Jyznk8ug", "title": "Five-Hundred Years of Chaucer Criticism and Allusion, 1357-1900", "title_without_series": "Five-Hundred Years of Chaucer Criticism and Allusion, 1357-1900", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3205951-five-hundred-years-of-chaucer-criticism-and-allusion-1357-1900", "num_pages": null, "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "393936", "name": "Caroline Frances Eleanor Spurgeon", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/f_200x266-3061b784cc8e7f021c6430c9aba94587.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/f_50x66-6a03a5c12233c941481992b82eea8d23.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/393936.Caroline_Frances_Eleanor_Spurgeon", "average_rating": "3.97", "ratings_count": "71", "text_reviews_count": "9"}}, "published": null, "work": {"id": "3239397", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.1oY_j1rstRTf0d7nXP1L0w"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "33241282"}, "isbn": "1334509581", "isbn13": "9781334509582", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.VFRpBMs3pR8ZSEk1OYbSuQ", "title": "Five Hundred Years of Chaucer Criticism and Allusion, (1357-1900), Vol. 2: Section I, Text 1801-1850 (Classic Reprint)", "title_without_series": "Five Hundred Years of Chaucer Criticism and Allusion, (1357-1900), Vol. 2: Section I, Text 1801-1850", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1481166723m/33241282.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1481166723s/33241282.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33241282-five-hundred-years-of-chaucer-criticism-and-allusion-1357-1900-vol", "num_pages": "464", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Forgotten Books", "publication_day": "22", "publication_year": "2018", "publication_month": "4", "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": "Excerpt from Five Hundred Years of Chaucer Criticism and Allusion, (1357-1900), Vol. 2: Section I, d104 1801-1850<br /><br />Wednesday Morning, 9ih December.

Harun is the legendary caliph of The Thousand and One Nights, but his actual court was nearly as magnificent as the fictional one. In The Caliph\u2019s Splendor, Benson Bobrick eloquently tells the little-known and remarkable story of Harun\u2019s rise to power and his rivalries with the neighboring Byzantines and the new Frankish kingdom under the leadership of Charlemagne. <br /><br />When Harun came to power, Islam stretched from the Atlantic to India. The Islamic empire was the mightiest on earth and the largest ever seen. Although Islam spread largely through war, its cultural achievements were immense. Harun\u2019s court at Baghdad outshone the independent Islamic emirate in Spain and all the courts of Europe, for that matter. In Baghdad, great works from Greece and Rome were preserved and studied, and new learning enhanced civilization. Over the following centuries Arab and Persian civilizations made a lasting impact on the West in astronomy, geometry, algebra (an Arabic word), medicine, and chemistry, among other fields of science. The alchemy (another Arabic word) of the Middle Ages originated with the Arabs. From engineering to jewelry to fashion to weaponry, Arab influences would shape life in the West, as they did in the fields of law, music, and literature. <br /><br />But for centuries Arabs and Byzantines contended fiercely on land and sea. Bobrick tells how Harun defeated attempts by the Byzantines to advance into Asia at his expense. He contemplated an alliance with the much weaker Charlemagne in order to contain the Byzantines, and in time Arabs and Byzantines reached an accommodation that permitted both to prosper. Harun\u2019s caliphate would weaken from within as his two sons quarreled and formed factions; eventually Arabs would give way to Turks in the Islamic empire. <br /><br />Empires rise, weaken, and fall, but during its golden age, the caliphate of Baghdad made a permanent contribution to civilization, as Benson Bobrick so splendidly reminds us.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "36845", "name": "Benson Bobrick", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1316903023p5/36845.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1316903023p2/36845.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/36845.Benson_Bobrick", "average_rating": "3.93", "ratings_count": "1700", "text_reviews_count": "280"}}, "published": "2012", "work": {"id": "18461756", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.6RVpgwhg7mOBpuuFk-hTYg"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "319949"}, "isbn": "0743224825", "isbn13": "9780743224826", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "8"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.etJAabmYSG36KB-OylGMFA", "title": "The Fated Sky: Astrology in History", "title_without_series": "The Fated Sky: Astrology in History", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/319949.The_Fated_Sky", "num_pages": "379", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Simon & Schuster (NY et al.)", "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "3.71", "ratings_count": "105", "description": "In a horoscope he cast in 1647 for Charles I, Wm Lilly, a noted English astrologer, noted the following: 'Luna is with Antares, a violent fixed star, which is said to denote violent death, &amp; Mars is approaching Caput Algol, which is said to denote beheading.' Two years later the king's head fell on the block. 'Astrology must be right,' wrote the American astrologer Evangeline Adams, claimed descendant of John Quincy Adams, in a challenge to skeptics in 1929. 'There can be no appeal from the Infinite.' The Fated Sky explores both the history of astrology &amp; the controversial subject of its historical influence. It's the 1st serious book to fully engage astrology in this way.<br /> Astrology is the oldest occult sciences, also the origin of science itself. Astronomy, mathematics &amp; other disciplines arose in part to make possible the calculations necessary in casting horoscopes. For 5000 years, the influence of the stars has been viewed as shaping the course of affairs. According to recent polls, at least 30% of Americans believe in it, tho modern astrology is utterly different from the doctrine of the stars that won the respect &amp; allegiance of the greatest thinkers, scientists &amp; writers--Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Arab &amp; Persian--of earlier days. Statesmen, popes &amp; kings once embraced it. Th Aquinas found it compatible with Xian faith. There are some 200 allusions to it in Shakespeare's plays, all their predictions fulfilled. The great astronomers of the scientific revolution--Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Kepler--were adherents. Newton's appetite for mathematics was whetted by an astrological text. Prominent figures such as Churchill, deGaulle &amp; Reagan have consulted astrologers, heeding their advice. Universities as diverse as Oxford &amp; Spain's Univ. of Zaragoza offer courses in the subject, fulfilling Jung's prediction that astrology would again become the subject of serious discourse. Whether astrology actually has the powers ascribed to it is open to debate. But there's no doubt that it maintains a hold on the human mind. The Fated Sky gives a comprehensive account of this subject &amp; its enduring influence on history &amp; the history of ideas.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "36845", "name": "Benson Bobrick", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1316903023p5/36845.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1316903023p2/36845.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/36845.Benson_Bobrick", "average_rating": "3.93", "ratings_count": "1700", "text_reviews_count": "280"}}, "published": null, "work": {"id": "1141497", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.NOu607w7s511-FqLWAHrwA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1067212"}, "isbn": "0671667556", "isbn13": "9780671667559", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "15"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.Ah3ia0HOGhJfztB7uTP03A", "title": "East of the Sun: The Epic Conquest and Tragic History of Siberia", "title_without_series": "East of the Sun: The Epic Conquest and Tragic History of Siberia", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1067212.East_of_the_Sun", "num_pages": "542", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": "1st", "publisher": "Poseidon Press/Simon & Schuster (NY)", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "1992", "publication_month": "10", "average_rating": "4.04", "ratings_count": "82", "description": "In sweep, color &amp; grandeur, the conquest &amp; settlement of Siberia compares with the winning of the American West. It's the greatest pioneering story in history, uniquely combining the heroic colonization of an intractable virgin land, the ghastly dangers &amp; high adventure of Arctic exploration, &amp; the grimmest saga of penal servitude. 400 years of continual human striving chart its course, a drama of unremitting extremes &amp; elemental confrontations, pitting man against nature, &amp; man against man. East of the Sun, a work of panoramic scope, is the 1st complete account of this strange &amp; terrible story. To most Westerners, Siberia is a vast &amp; mysterious place. The richest resource area on the face of the earth, its land mass covers 5 million square miles-7.5% of the total land surface of the globe. From the 1st foray in 1581 across the Ural Mountains by a band of Cossack outlaws to the fall of Gorbachev, East of the Sun is history on a grand scale. With vivid immediacy, Bobrick describes the often brutal subjugation of Siberia's aboriginal tribes &amp; the cultures that were destroyed; the great 18th-century explorations that defined Siberia's borders &amp; Russia's attempt to \"extend\" Siberia further with settlements in Alaska, California &amp; Hawaii; &amp; the transformation of Siberia into a penal colony for criminal &amp; political exiles, an experiment more terrible than Australia's Botany Bay. There's the building of the stupendous Trans-Siberian Railway across 7 time zones; Siberia's key role in the bloody aftermath of the October Revolution in 1917; &amp; Stalin's dreaded Gulag, which corrupted its very soil. Today, Siberia is the hope of Russia's future, now that all her appended republic have broken away. Its story has never been more timely.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "36845", "name": "Benson Bobrick", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1316903023p5/36845.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1316903023p2/36845.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/36845.Benson_Bobrick", "average_rating": "3.93", "ratings_count": "1700", "text_reviews_count": "280"}}, "published": "1992", "work": {"id": "1141498", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.R9EgrlYdhZyMDBS3pw7Ulw"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "65265"}, "isbn": "074325113X", "isbn13": "9780743251136", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "11"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.rllivzke0lcUTvA0dCY2Ew", "title": "Testament: A Soldier's Story of the Civil War", "title_without_series": "Testament: A Soldier's Story of the Civil War", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65265.Testament", "num_pages": "277", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "publication_day": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "publication_month": "8", "average_rating": "3.42", "ratings_count": "67", "description": "The story of the author's great-grandfather's Civil War experience, based on a remarkable set of newly discoverd letters\u2014a powerful, moving addition to the firsthand soldiers' accounts of the Civil War.<br /><br /><i>Dear Mother,<br /> I was very glad to hear from home this morning.

This story is true.<br /><br />In <i>Testament,</i> Benson Bobrick draws upon an extraordinarily rich but hitherto untapped archive of material to create a continuous narrative of how that war was fought and lived. Here is virtually the whole theater of conflict in the West, from its beginnings in Missouri, through Kentucky and Tennessee, to the siege of Atlanta under Sherman, as experienced by Bobrick's great-grandfather, Benjamin W. (\"Webb\") Baker, an articulate young Illinois recruit. Born and raised not far from the Lincoln homestead in Coles County, Webb had stood in the audience of one of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, become a staunch Unionist, and answered one of Abraham Lincoln's first calls for volunteers. The ninety-odd letters on which his story is based are fully equal to the best letters the war produced, especially by a common soldier; but their wry intelligence, fortitude, and patriotic fervor also set them apart with a singular and still-undying voice.<br /><br />In the end, that voice blends with the author's own, as the book becomes a poignant tribute to his great-grandfather's life -- and to all the common soldiers of the nation's bloodiest war.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "36845", "name": "Benson Bobrick", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1316903023p5/36845.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1316903023p2/36845.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/36845.Benson_Bobrick", "average_rating": "3.93", "ratings_count": "1700", "text_reviews_count": "280"}}, "published": "2004", "work": {"id": "2910862", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.BG6Hh6pPNtYFCuqqo3mLww"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "3367421"}, "isbn": "0399132562", "isbn13": "9780399132568", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "7"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.hk7RfRKdT_9d4wJgGDwJyA", "title": "Fearful Majesty: The Life and Reign of Ivan the Terrible", "title_without_series": "Fearful Majesty: The Life and Reign of Ivan the Terrible", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1495230983m/3367421.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1495230983s/3367421.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3367421-fearful-majesty", "num_pages": "398", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "G.P.

Intellectuals largely supported the social and economic reforms of the 1930s, the war against Hitler's Germany, and U.S. conduct during the Cold War. By the early 1960s, a liberal intellectual consensus existed.<br /><br />The war in Southeast Asia shattered this fragile coalition, which promptly dissolved into numerous camps, each of which questioned American institutions, values, and ideals. Robert R. Tomes sheds new light on the demise of Cold War liberalism and the development of the New Left, and the steady growth of a conservatism that used Vietnam, and anti-war sentiment, as a rallying point. Importantly, Tomes provides new evidence that neoconservatism retreated from internationalism due largely to Vietnam, only to regroup later with substantially diminished goals and expectations.<br /><br />Covering vast archival terrain, <b>Apocalypse Then</b> stands as the definitive account of the impact of the Vietnam war on American intellectual life.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "867304", "name": "Robert Tomes", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/867304.Robert_Tomes", "average_rating": "3.71", "ratings_count": "14", "text_reviews_count": "1"}}, "published": "2000", "work": {"id": "3364721", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.VvFM9zwspon_77yHX1Z04g"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "2244784"}, "isbn": "1425526357", "isbn13": "9781425526351", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.x9ZPRIRjmjsC1qUhVLseCA", "title": "The Bazar Book of Decorum. the Care of the Person, Manners, Etiquette, and Ceremonials ...", "title_without_series": "The Bazar Book of Decorum. the Care of the Person, Manners, Etiquette, and Ceremonials ...", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2244784.The_Bazar_Book_of_Decorum_the_Care_of_the_Person_Manners_Etiquette_and_Ceremonials_", "num_pages": null, "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "University of Michigan Library", "publication_day": "13", "publication_year": "2006", "publication_month": "9", "average_rating": "3.00", "ratings_count": "1", "description": "This is a reproduction of a book published before 1923.

The religious orders of the Catholic Church were the front-line representatives of Western culture and the ones who met indigenous America face-to-face. They were also the primary agents of religious change. In this book, Nicholas Cushner provides the first comprehensive overview and analysis of the American missionary activities of the Jesuits. From the North American encounter with the Indians of Florida in 1565, through Mexico, New France, the Paraguay Reductions, Andean Perus, to contact with Native Americans in Maryland on the eve of the American Revolution, members of the order interacted with both native elites and colonizers. Drawing on the abundant documentation of and scholarship about these encounters, Cushner examines how the Jesuits behaved toward the indigenous population and analyzes the way in which native belief systems were replaced by Christianity. He seeks to understand how and why the initial European-Indian encounter changed not only the religion of the natives, but also their material culture, economic activity, social organization, and even their sexual behavior. Always sensitive to the influence of European \"cultural filters\" on Jesuit accounts, Cushner attempts as far as possible to discover the authentic voices of the Native Americans with whom they interacted. The result is a fascinating and highly accessible introduction to the earliest colonial encounters in the Americas.<br />", "authors": {"author": {"id": "44940", "name": "Nicholas P.

Graduated from West Point in 1842 (where his record characterizes him as \u201ccorrect in his deportment, social and communicative. . . rather adverse to outdoor sports and retiring in his manner\u201d), Doubleday was an active participant in the Mexican War (1840s), the Seminole Wars in Florida (1850s), a veteran of service on the Texas frontier (1850s, 1870s), the man who ordered the first Union salvo from Fort Sumter in April 1861, and a veteran of many Civil War battles, including Gettysburg and Chancellorsville. He retired from the United States Army in 1873 and died in 1893.<br /><br />Doubleday was also the author of two published books on his Civil War experiences. <i>My Life in the Old Army</i>, however, is composed of a set of previously unpublished writings (the originals are housed at the New-York Historical Society) primarily about Doubleday\u2019s tour of duty during the Mexican War. He was on hand for the first shots of the war, for the battles of Monterrey and Buena Vista, and later served in Saltillo after the campaign moved farther south toward Mexico City. Fluent in Spanish, he traveled far and wide in Mexico and describes his experiences. \u201cThis is the very life I had been desirous of leading,\u201d he writes. \u201cTo mix with the Mexican rancheros and see more of their manner of living.\u201d The volume includes chapters on campaigns against hostile Native Americans in Texas and Florida.<br /><br />Throughout his life, according to editor Joseph Chance, Doubleday collected anecdotes and stories of the great and the forgotten military men of the United States. Thus the book closes with a light-hearted final chapter about the \u201cOld Army.\u201d<br /><br />Whether Doubleday invented baseball during one of his many tours in Texas may never be known. His narrative mentions nothing of the great American pastime.<br /><br />Copious notes and a complete bibliography enhance the volume.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "5790018", "name": "Joseph Chance", "role": "Editor", "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5790018.Joseph_Chance", "average_rating": "5.00", "ratings_count": "1", "text_reviews_count": "0"}}, "published": "1998", "work": {"id": "217971", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.mNTbXbDsWjtuzNzbfYZZ5g"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "3187209"}, "isbn": "0874041988", "isbn13": "9780874041989", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.J6ny-H53h8biVfkn6XUtzg", "title": "The March to Monterrey: The Diary of Lieutenant Rankin Dilworth, U.S. Army : A Narrative of Troop Movements and Observations on Daily Life With General Zachary Taylor's Army", "title_without_series": "The March to Monterrey: The Diary of Lieutenant Rankin Dilworth, U.S. Army : A Narrative of Troop Movements and Observations on Daily Life With General Zachary Taylor's Army", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3187209-the-march-to-monterrey", "num_pages": "119", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Texas Western Press-University of Texas at El Paso", "publication_day": "15", "publication_year": "1996", "publication_month": "5", "average_rating": "3.00", "ratings_count": "1", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "1356260", "name": "Rankin Dilworth", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1356260.Rankin_Dilworth", "average_rating": "3.00", "ratings_count": "1", "text_reviews_count": "0"}}, "published": "1996", "work": {"id": "3220131", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.3jQMy-f0CcUDfZ4NYZrqrw"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "22762401"}, "isbn": "0585036322", "isbn13": "9780585036328", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.kTHPA5yNijRYQbVzjuK35A", "title": "My Life in the Old Army: The Reminiscences of Abner Doubleday from the Collections of the New-York Historical Society", "title_without_series": "My Life in the Old Army: The Reminiscences of Abner Doubleday from the Collections of the New-York Historical Society", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22762401-my-life-in-the-old-army", "num_pages": "409", "format": "ebook", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Texas Christian University Press", "publication_day": "13", "publication_year": "2014", "publication_month": "5", "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": "Often thought of as the inventor of baseball - the great American pastime - Abner Doubleday was first and foremost a soldier.

Jackson was one of the giants of the Roosevelt era: an Attorney General, a still revered Supreme Court Justice and, not least important, one of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's close friends and advisers. His intimate memoir of FDR, written in the early 1950s before Jackson's untimely death, has remained unpublished for fifty years. Here is that newly discovered memoir.<br /> Written with skill and grace, this is truly a unique account of the personality, conduct, greatness of character, and common humanity of \"that man in the White House,\" as outraged conservatives called FDR. Jackson simply but eloquently provides an insider's view of Roosevelt's presidency, including such crucial events as FDR's Court-packing plan, his battles with corporate America, his decision to seek a third term, and his bold move to aid Britain in 1940 with American destroyers. He also offers an intimate personal portrait of Roosevelt--on fishing trips, in late-night poker games, or approving legislation while eating breakfast in bed, where he routinely began his workday. We meet a president who is far-sighted but nimble in attacking the problems at hand; principled but flexible; charismatic and popular but unafraid to pick fights, take stands, and when necessary, make enemies. <br /><em>That Man</em> is not simply a valuable historical document, but an engaging and insightful look at one of the most remarkable men in American history. In reading this memoir, we gain not only a new appreciation for Roosevelt, but also admiration for Jackson, who emerges as both a public servant of great integrity and skill and a wry, shrewd, and fair-minded observer of politics at the highest level.<br />", "authors": {"author": {"id": "54961", "name": "Robert H.

The authors use production records to show the missions were quite effective in serving the economic goals. Also carefully assessed are the efforts to transform the culture and world view of Indians by delineating how they coped, their history of disease and death, and their efforts at resistance.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "54961", "name": "Robert H.

The native peoples generally viewed the new religion in terms very different from that of the missionaries. As conflict broke out after 1550 as Spaniards invaded the Chichimeca frontier (the frontier between sedentary and nomadic natives), the missionaries faced new challenges on both sides of the frontier. Some sedentary natives resisted evangelization, and the missionaries saw themselves in a war against Satan and his minions. The Augustinians assumed a pivotal role in the evangelization campaign on both sides of the Chichimeca frontier, and employed different methods in the effort to convince the natives to embrace the new faith and to defeat Satan s designs. They used graphic visual aids and the threat of an eternity of suffering in hell to bring recalcitrant natives, such as the Otomi of the Mezquital Valley, into the fold.\"", "authors": {"author": {"id": "54961", "name": "Robert H.

The group he was working with was in the middle of a yearlong power battle in which the older chimpanzees were being ousted in favor of a younger group. One day Andrew carelessly forgot to secure his rowboat at the mainland and looked up to see it floating over to the chimp island. In an orchestrated fashion, five ousted members of the chimp group quietly came from different parts of the island and boarded the boat. Without confusion, they sat in two perfect rows of two, with Higgy, the deposed alpha male, at the back, propelling and steering the boat to shore. The incident occurred without screams or disorder and appeared to have been preplanned and communicated. Since this event, Andrew has extensively studied primate communication and, in particular, how this group of chimpanzees naturally communicated. What he found is that chimpanzees use a set of vocalizations every bit as complex as human language. <i>The Song of the Ape</i> traces the individual histories of each of the five chimpanzees on the boat, some of whom came to the zoo after being wild-caught chimps raised as pets, circus performers, and lab chimps, and examines how these histories led to the common lexicon of the group.<br /><br />Interspersed with these histories, the book details the long history of scientists attempting (and failing) to train apes to use human grammar and language, using the well-known and controversial examples of Koko the gorilla, Kanzi the bonobo, and Nim Chimsky the chimpanzee, all of whom supposedly were able to communicate with their human caretakers using sign language.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book shows that while laboratories try in vain to teach human grammar to a chimpanzee, there is a living lexicon being passed down through the generations of each chimpanzee group in the wild. Halloran demonstrates what that lexicon looks like with twenty-five phrases he recorded, isolated, and interpreted while working with the chimps, and concludes that what is occurring in nature is far more fascinating and miraculous than anything that can be created in a laboratory.<br /><br /><i>The Song of the Ape</i> is a lively, engaging, and personal account, with many moments of humor as well as the occasional heartbreak, and it will appeal to anyone who wants to listen in as our closest relatives converse.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "5074285", "name": "Andrew R.

In this groundbreaking study, Jawid Mojaddedi reaches to the heart of the matter by examining Rumi's teachings on walaya (Friendship with God) in light of earlier discourse in the wider Sufi tradition and juridico-theological Islam. Walaya is not only central to Rumi's teachings, but forms the basis for the celebration of intimacy, communication with the Divine, and transcendence of conventional religiosity in his poetry. And yet walaya is the aspect of Sufism which has proven the most difficult to reconcile with juridico-theological Islam. <br />In addition to its focus on Rumi, Beyond Dogma presents a perceptive analysis of the historical development of the discourse on walaya in the formative centuries of Sufism. This period coincides with the time when juridico-theological Islam rose to dominance, as reflected in the harmonizing efforts of theoretical Sufi writings, especially the manuals of the tenth and eleventh centuries. Mojaddedi's analysis facilitates a nuanced and contextualized evaluation of Rumi's teachings on walaya, which had already attracted a range of views before his time: from arguments in favor of its superiority to Prophethood, to guarantees of subordinate deference towards the Prophetic heritage interpreted by juridico-theological scholars. In the process, Beyond Dogma enables a fresh evaluation of the influential early Sufi manuals in their historical context, while also highlighting the significance for juridico-theological scholars of fundamental dogma in the process of consolidating their own dominance.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "498012", "name": "Jawid Mojaddedi", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/498012.Jawid_Mojaddedi", "average_rating": "4.46", "ratings_count": "836", "text_reviews_count": "48"}}, "published": "2012", "work": {"id": "20476426", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.HoFeincDo4Oj-g-9JFIQKA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1171550"}, "isbn": "070071359X", "isbn13": "9780700713592", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.SWPmyxlxye7iNUmGT2ofdw", "title": "The Biographical Tradition in Sufism: The Tabaqat Genre from Al-Sulami to Jami", "title_without_series": "The Biographical Tradition in Sufism: The Tabaqat Genre from Al-Sulami to Jami", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1171550.The_Biographical_Tradition_in_Sufism", "num_pages": "230", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Routledge", "publication_day": "21", "publication_year": "2000", "publication_month": "12", "average_rating": "3.50", "ratings_count": "2", "description": "This book is a study of the major works of Sufi historiography, which takes the form of collections of biographies.

He excelled as an essayist, lecturer and conversationalist; and as a brilliant speaker who delivered, rapidly and spontaneously, richly allusive and coherently structured material, whether for a lecture series at Oxford University or as a broadcaster on the BBC Third Programme, usually without a script. Many of his essays and lectures were later collected in book form.<br /><br />Born in Riga, now capital of Latvia, then part of the Russian Empire, he was the first person of Jewish descent to be elected to a prize fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford. From 1957 to 1967, he was Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory at the University of Oxford. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1963 to 1964. In 1966, he helped to found Wolfson College, Oxford, and became its first President. He was knighted in 1957, and was awarded the Order of Merit in 1971. He was President of the British Academy from 1974 to 1978. He also received the 1979 Jerusalem Prize for his writings on individual freedom. Berlin's work on liberal theory has had a lasting influence.<br /><br />Berlin is best known for his essay <i>Two Concepts of Liberty</i>, delivered in 1958 as his inaugural lecture as Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory at Oxford. He defined negative liberty as the absence of constraints on, or interference with, agents' possible action. Greater \"<i>negative freedom</i>\" meant fewer restrictions on possible action. Berlin associated positive liberty with the idea of self-mastery, or the capacity to determine oneself, to be in control of one's destiny. While Berlin granted that both concepts of liberty represent valid human ideals, as a matter of history the positive concept of liberty has proven particularly susceptible to political abuse.<br /><br />Berlin contended that under the influence of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant and G. W. F. Hegel (all committed to the positive concept of liberty), European political thinkers often equated liberty with forms of political discipline or constraint. This became politically dangerous when notions of positive liberty were, in the nineteenth century, used to defend nationalism, self-determination and the Communist idea of collective rational control over human destiny. Berlin argued that, following this line of thought, demands for freedom paradoxically become demands for forms of collective control and discipline \u2013 those deemed necessary for the \"<i>self-mastery</i>\" or self-determination of nations, classes, democratic communities, and even humanity as a whole. There is thus an elective affinity, for Berlin, between positive liberty and political totalitarianism.<br /><br />Conversely, negative liberty represents a different, perhaps safer, understanding of the concept of liberty. Its proponents (such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill) insisted that constraint and discipline were the antithesis of liberty and so were (and are) less prone to confusing liberty and constraint in the manner of the philosophical harbingers of modern totalitarianism. It is this concept of <i>Negative Liberty</i> that Isaiah Berlin supported. It dominated heavily his early chapters in his third lecture.<br /><br />This negative liberty is central to the claim for toleration due to incommensurability. This concept is mirrored in the work of Joseph Raz.<br /><br />Berlin's espousal of negative liberty, his hatred of totalitarianism and his experience of Russia in the revolution and through his contact with the poet Anna Akhmatova made him an enemy of the Soviet Union and he was one of the leading public intellectuals in the ideological battle against Communism during the Cold War.", "influences": null, "works_count": "81", "gender": null, "hometown": "Riga", "born_at": "1909/06/06", "died_at": "1997/11/05", "goodreads_author": null, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "87436"}, "isbn": "1566630193", "isbn13": "9781566630191", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "75"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.euLWl3vWUB_WYUV0qflblA", "title": "The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy's View of History", "title_without_series": "The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy's View of History", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344761981m/87436.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344761981s/87436.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87436.The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox", "num_pages": "96", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Ivan R.

He has also added further pieces that bear on the same topic, so that Berlin's principal statements on liberty are at last available together in one volume. Finally, in an extended preface and in appendices drawn from Berlin's unpublished writings, he exhibits some of the biographical sources of Berlin's lifelong preoccupation with liberalism.

A published version has been keenly awaited ever since the lectures were given, and Berlin had always hoped to complete a book based on them. But despite extensive further work this hope was not fulfilled, and the present volume is an edited transcript of his spoken words.For Berlin, the Romantics set in motion a vast, unparalleled revolution in humanity's view of itself. They destroyed the traditional notions of objective truth and validity in ethics with incalculable, all-pervasive results. As he said of the Romantics elsewhere: \"The world has never been the same since, and our politics and morals have been deeply transformed by them. Certainly this has been the most radical, and indeed dramatic, not to say terrifying, change in men's outlook in modern times.\"<br /><br />In these brilliant lectures Berlin surveys the myriad attempts to define Romanticism, distills its essence, traces its developments from its first stirrings to its apotheosis, and shows how its lasting legacy permeates our own outlook. Combining the freshness and immediacy of the spoken word with Berlin's inimitable eloquence and wit, the lectures range over a cast of the greatest thinkers and artists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including Kant, Rousseau, Diderot, Schiller, Schlegel, Novalis, Goethe, Blake, Byron, and Beethoven. Berlin argues that the ideas and attitudes held by these and other figures helped to shape twentieth-century nationalism, existentialism, democracy, totalitarianism,and our ideas about heroic individuals, individual self-fulfillment, and the exalted place of art. This is the record of an intellectual bravura performance--of one of the century's most influential philosophers dissecting and assessing a movement that changed the course of history.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "45752", "name": "Isaiah Berlin", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1252241124p5/45752.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1252241124p2/45752.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/45752.Isaiah_Berlin", "average_rating": "4.05", "ratings_count": "8482", "text_reviews_count": "801"}}, "published": "2001", "work": {"id": "829242", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.5YKJDST6AkrNId5rDOr4Yg"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "84707"}, "isbn": "0140136258", "isbn13": "9780140136258", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "21"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.YbarHIJghtgJ1MXBB34XpA", "title": "Russian Thinkers", "title_without_series": "Russian Thinkers", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84707.Russian_Thinkers", "num_pages": "336", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Penguin Books", "publication_day": "25", "publication_year": "1979", "publication_month": "10", "average_rating": "4.27", "ratings_count": "522", "description": "The theme that links the essays in this book, written over 30 years, is the phenomenon of the Russian intelligentsia, which Isaiah Berlin describes as the largest single Russian contribution to social change in the world.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "45752", "name": "Isaiah Berlin", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1252241124p5/45752.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1252241124p2/45752.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/45752.Isaiah_Berlin", "average_rating": "4.05", "ratings_count": "8482", "text_reviews_count": "801"}}, "published": "1979", "work": {"id": "1184302", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.KjQodSg4PA8nHv0i4zEYxA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "87435"}, "isbn": "0712606165", "isbn13": "9780712606165", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "20"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.tJ58_54UYZnMT9oyB1gWoQ", "title": "The Crooked Timber of Humanity: Chapters in the History of Ideas", "title_without_series": "The Crooked Timber of Humanity: Chapters in the History of Ideas", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87435.The_Crooked_Timber_of_Humanity", "num_pages": "276", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Pimlico", "publication_day": "4", "publication_year": "2003", "publication_month": "9", "average_rating": "4.11", "ratings_count": "522", "description": "Isaiah Berlin is regarded by many as one of the greatest historians of ideas of his time.

He was constitutionally incapable of writing with the opacity of the specialist, but these shorter, more introductory pieces provide the perfect starting-point for the reader new to his work. Those who are already familiar with his writing will also be grateful for this further addition to his collected essays.<br /><br /><br /> The connecting theme of these essays, as in the case of earlier volumes, is the crucial social and political role--past, present and future--of ideas, and of their progenitors. A rich variety of subject-matters is represented--from philosophy to education, from Russia to Israel, from Marxism to romanticism--so that the truth of Heine's warning is exemplified on a broad front. It is a warning that Berlin often referred to, and provides an answer to those who ask, as from time to time they do, why intellectual history matters.<br /><br /><br /> Among the contributions are \"My Intellectual Path,\" Berlin's last essay, a retrospective autobiographical survey of his main preoccupations; and \"Jewish Slavery and Emancipation,\" the classic statement of his Zionist views, long unavailable in print. His other subjects include the Enlightenment, Giambattista Vico, Vissarion Belinsky, Alexander Herzen, G.V. Plekhanov, the Russian intelligentsia, the idea of liberty, political realism, nationalism, and historicism. The book exhibits the full range of his enormously wide expertise and demonstrates the striking and enormously engaging individuality, as well as the power, of his own ideas.<br /><br /><br /> \"Over a hundred years ago, the German poet Heine warned the French not to underestimate the power of ideas: philosophical concepts nurtured in the stillness of a professor's study could destroy a civilization.\"--Isaiah Berlin, <i>Two Concepts of Liberty</i>, 1958", "authors": {"author": {"id": "45752", "name": "Isaiah Berlin", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1252241124p5/45752.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1252241124p2/45752.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/45752.Isaiah_Berlin", "average_rating": "4.05", "ratings_count": "8482", "text_reviews_count": "801"}}, "published": "2002", "work": {"id": "84405", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.K6Gya70bTu00Oq1YSy_yjw"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "2976812"}, "isbn": "0691090998", "isbn13": "9780691090993", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "17"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.1Bzgj0Ig9CmGk62c7jgyvA", "title": "Freedom and its Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty", "title_without_series": "Freedom and its Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2976812-freedom-and-its-betrayal", "num_pages": "180", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "publication_day": "17", "publication_year": "2002", "publication_month": "2", "average_rating": "4.25", "ratings_count": "182", "description": "Isaiah Berlin's celebrated radio lectures on six formative anti-liberal thinkers were broadcast by the BBC in 1952. They are published here for the first time, fifty years later. They comprise one of Berlin's earliest and most convincing expositions of his views on human freedom and on the history of ideas--views that later found expression in such famous works as \"Two Concepts of Liberty,\" and were at the heart of his lifelong work on the Enlightenment and its critics. Working with BBC transcripts and Berlin's annotated drafts, Henry Hardy has recreated these lectures, which consolidated the forty-three-year-old Berlin's growing reputation as a man who could speak about intellectual matters in an accessible and involving way.<br /><br /><br /> In his lucid examination of sometimes complex ideas, Berlin demonstrates that a balanced understanding and a resilient defense of human liberty depend on learning both from the errors of freedom's alleged defenders and from the dark insights of its avowed antagonists. This book throws light on the early development of Berlin's most influential ideas and supplements his already published writings with fuller treatments of Helv\ufffdtius, Rousseau, Fichte, Hegel, and Saint-Simon, with the ultra-conservative Maistre bringing up the rear. These thinkers gave to freedom a new dimension of power--power that, Berlin argues, has historically brought about less, not more, individual liberty.<br /><br /><br /> These lectures show Berlin at his liveliest and most torrentially spontaneous, testifying to his talents as a teacher of rare brilliance and impact. Listeners tuned in expectantly each week to the hour-long broadcasts and found themselves mesmerized by Berlin's astonishingly fluent extempore style. One listener, a leading historian of ideas who was then a schoolboy, was to recount that the lectures \"excited me so much that I sat, for every talk, on the floor beside the wireless, taking notes.\" This excitement is at last recreated here for all to share.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "45752", "name": "Isaiah Berlin", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1252241124p5/45752.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1252241124p2/45752.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/45752.Isaiah_Berlin", "average_rating": "4.05", "ratings_count": "8482", "text_reviews_count": "801"}}, "published": "2002", "work": {"id": "3007177", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.n6HGaYVqcQRc5PTgYcXX-A"}}]}}}}, "1184434": {"GoodreadsResponse": {"Request": {"authentication": "true", "key": "9ri8jiLcNvV2GMvk5HVidg", "method": "author_show"}, "author": {"id": "1184434", "name": "Arthur M.

For more than a half century, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. was at the vital center of American political and cultural life. From his entrance into political leadership circles in the 1950s through his years in the Kennedy White House and up until his very last days, he was that rare thing, a master historian who enjoyed an extraordinary eyewitness vantage on history as it was being made. On intimate terms with many of the most prominent political, cultural and intellectual figures of the last fifty years, he was a man whose proximity to power never obscured his appreciation for the reality of those who have none. For that capacity for empathy and for much else, he was often called American liberalism's greatest voice. For most of his adult life, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. dutifully recorded his experiences and opinions in journals that, until now, have never been seen. Edited by his oldest sons, they offer remarkably fresh and lucid observations on a half century of public life, and a rare and privileged view into the mind of one of America's most distinguished men of letters. Frank, revelatory, suffused with wit and humanity, these entries offer an intimate history of postwar America, from his days on Adlai Stevenson's campaign team to his years in JFK and RFK's inner circle, through to the election of George W. Bush. They contain his candid reminiscences about many of the signal events of our time - the Bay of Pigs, the devastating assassinations of the 1960s, Vietnam, Watergate, the fall of the Soviet Union, Bush v. Gore. These journals also offer an extraordinary window into the lives of the wide range of politicians, intellectuals, writers and actors who were his friends - from the Kennedys to the Clintons, from Henry Kissinger to Adlai Stevenson, from Norman Mailer to Lauren Bacall. Together they form an astonishingly vivid portrait of American politics and culture in the second half of the 20th century - one that only a man who knew everyone and missed nothing, could provide. Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. was one of America's greatest moral and intellectual forces, and the publication of his journals is both itself an epic event in the history of American letters, and a fitting opportunity to celebrate this most remarkable American life.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "1184434", "name": "Arthur M.

Through his many books, which are accessible to ordinary readers as well as illuminating for psychotherapists, he has provided a guide for living in a perplexing world. A recent poll of American psychotherapists voted him to be one of the three most important living therapists, but the worldwide success of his books suggests that his prominence is international Rather than positioning himself as a representative of one of the hundreds of \"schools\" or approaches to psychotherapy, Yalom offers a message that goes to the heart of psychotherapy. Taking up the central existential concerns of human life, Yalom's work engages the problems of finding meaning in life and confronting death, concerns that had lain beyond the scope of psychiatry. Writing in a literary style that reviewers have compared to Freud, Yalom details what actually happens in the intimate human encounter that is psychotherapy. Yalom does not shrink from exposing his own thoughts and feelings about what occurs; he, too, is a vulnerable and searching human being. He makes his thinking about his patients, and his efforts to treat them, transparent, exposing his doubts, reservations and struggles as well as his insights. He has written two textbooks, two volumes of case history stories, three novels about therapy, a guide for therapists and one book of counsel for the masses confronting death. Across all of this work, he explores the limitless and complex possibilities of the healing inherent in genuine human connection and authentic awareness of the dilemmas of human existence. This book Irvin Yalom: OnPsychotherapy and the Human Condition traces the genesis and evolution of his thinking and presents some of the seminal ideas of his writings.

Selecting at random thirty young women in their last year of college, Josselson undertook a ground-breaking study that would follow these women's personal odysseys over the next twenty-two years, from graduation to midlife. With stunning candor and hard-won insight, the \"ordinary\" (and anonymous) women in Josselson's study reveal how much more complex and interesting real women's lives are than the one-dimensional stereotypes often portrayed in the media. Dismissing a traditional \"stage theory\" of development as overly simplistic, Josselson identifies four trajectories that women take from adolescence to adulthood. Guardians are the \"good girls\" - high achieving and committed to fulfilling their family's expectations, but rigid in outlook and resistant to change. Pathmakers are not afraid of risk or commitment, striving to balance their own needs with others'. The often idealistic Searchers are overwhelmed by choice and unable to make commitments, while Drifters live only for the moment, avoiding choice and an exploration of identity. Reflecting the degree to which women take risks, make choices, and form commitments, these paths form a foundation for adulthood - but they also lead to surprises: at midlife, Guardians seem strikingly able to \"cut loose\" from earlier traditional patterns, while many Drifters have \"found themselves, \" sometimes in quite traditional ways. And coming of age justas the feminist movement gathered momentum, the women in Josselson's study were the first to confront many contemporary issues not faced by their mothers, or their mothers' mothers.

Although others appear to us to be who they just 'are', there are complicated psychological processes, outside of our awareness, that lead us to experience people in ways that we ourselves construct. Psychoanalytic theory offers a wealth of understanding of how people unconsciously create what they both need and dread. But these processes are not well understood by most therapists. Too often, therapists join their patients in overlooking their own role in creating the relationships in their lives, such that it seems that patients were simply unfortunate to 'have' an un-giving mother or to 'find' an unloving spouse. Because processes of creation in relationship are largely unconscious, they are much harder to see. As a result, most theorists of relationships acknowledge that they exist, but offer little language or explication for how they unfold or manifest themselves. Playing Pygmalion is an effort to trace in psychological terms the subtle interplay by which people create the other. This book adapts the psychoanalytic concepts of transitional object usage and projective identification to show their importance and applicability beyond the therapeutic situation to the understanding of people's relational lives. Using examples from literature, film and clinical work to illustrate the theory, the book goes on to consider in depth the relationship narratives of four pairs of ordinary people to demonstrate how people unconsciously 'create' one another. The stories demonstrate that the 'other' is always more than one conceives him or her to be. Readers inevitably rethink some of their important relationships in terms of how they are creating people or being created by them. This may lead them to take in other aspects of the person, to see how they are looking very selectively at a human being who exists beyond their relationship. These stories also provide cautionary tales to therapists who begin to believe in the simple reality of their patients' constructions of important people in their lives.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "66379", "name": "Ruthellen Josselson", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/66379.Ruthellen_Josselson", "average_rating": "3.87", "ratings_count": "217", "text_reviews_count": "12"}}, "published": "2007", "work": {"id": "1584091", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.MZ4ISI_LpbiBNymvdbBxLQ"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "665019"}, "isbn": "1555422128", "isbn13": "9781555422127", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.YznuVMzMhl2hp_Ezl5Ziwg", "title": "Finding Herself: Pathways to Identity Development in Women", "title_without_series": "Finding Herself: Pathways to Identity Development in Women", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/665019.Finding_Herself", "num_pages": "224", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Jossey-Bass", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "1987", "publication_month": "1", "average_rating": "3.89", "ratings_count": "9", "description": "Breaking from traditional studies of women that focus on how women differ from men or use psychotherapy clients as research subjects, this book examines how normal women forge their individual identities.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "66379", "name": "Ruthellen Josselson", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/66379.Ruthellen_Josselson", "average_rating": "3.87", "ratings_count": "217", "text_reviews_count": "12"}}, "published": "1987", "work": {"id": "651078", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.CWubDKpGeQCb-8QWfeE-4A"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1211035"}, "isbn": "0803971079", "isbn13": "9780803971073", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.IcOk6b5VyOi0nX2XyPcmPQ", "title": "Interpreting Experience: The Narrative Study of Lives", "title_without_series": "Interpreting Experience: The Narrative Study of Lives", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1211035.Interpreting_Experience", "num_pages": null, "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Sage Publications", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "1995", "publication_month": "3", "average_rating": "3.83", "ratings_count": "6", "description": "The focus of this book is on the role of narrative analysis in the social sciences and in increasing our understanding of human lives and experiences.

How does the identity they choose (or not choose) by the end of their college career affect how their lives unfold? For 35 years, Ruthellen Josselson has followed 25 randomly selected women who graduated from college in the early 1970s. Because these women came of age at this particular time in history, they were the trailblazers in creating new possibilities for women's lives by taking up meaningful roles in the work world. These \"real\" women, in contrast to the stereotypes of the time, took on the challenge in very different ways and championed very different lives for themselves.<br /><br /><em>In Paths to Fulfillment: Women's Search for Meaning and Identity</em>, Josselson traces the stages of these women's lives and the ways in which identity, intimacy, and care for others over time leads to fulfillment, or in some cases, a lack of fulfillment. She examines the complexity of the relationship between a woman's roots, her efforts to create a unique life for herself, and how others become part of identity. Josselson examines individual lives in depth for clues to understanding the strengths that help a woman to find fulfillment, and how in generativity becomes an anchor for meaningful identity as lives unfold.<br /><br />With remarkable clarity and insight, Josselson challenges simplistic generalizations about women, and shows how work, love, and care are all intertwined in a woman's sense of identity.<br />", "authors": {"author": {"id": "66379", "name": "Ruthellen Josselson", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/66379.Ruthellen_Josselson", "average_rating": "3.87", "ratings_count": "217", "text_reviews_count": "12"}}, "published": "2017", "work": {"id": "52973028", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.fIOmcMjNsEHwYKWVVoGORw"}}]}}}}, "4504520": {"GoodreadsResponse": {"Request": {"authentication": "true", "key": "9ri8jiLcNvV2GMvk5HVidg", "method": "author_show"}, "author": {"id": "4504520", "name": "Lindsey R.

Swindall's knack for thorough, detailed research and reflection. Paul Robeson was, at points in his life, an actor, singer, football player, political activist and writer, one of the most diversely talented members of the Harlem Renaissance. Swindall centers Robeson's story around the argument that while Robeson leaned toward Socialism, a Pan-African perspective is fundamental to understanding his life as an artist and political advocate. Many previous works on Robeson have focused primarily on his involvement with the US Communist Party, paying little attention to the broader African influences on his politics and art. With each chapter focused on a decade of his life, this book affords us a fresh look at his story, and the ways in which the struggles, successes and studies of his formative years came to shape him as an artist, activist and man later on. Robeson's story is one not simply of politics and protest, but of a man's lifelong evolution from an athlete to an entertainer to an indispensible man of letters and African American thought. Swindall neatly outlines the events of Robeson's life in a way that freshly presents him as a man whose work was influenced by more than just his circumstances, but by a spirit rooted in dedication to the African's place in American art and politics.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "4504520", "name": "Lindsey R.

The escalating spread of fascism before World War II coupled with the economic crisis of the Great Depression and the mobilization of the Communist Party against segregation and colonialism helped expand the international awareness of many African American activists like Paul Robeson and W.E.B. Du Bois.<br /><br />The SNYC and the Council on African Affairs were part of the efforts to address race and labor issues within a leftist framework, employing a global, Pan-African perspective to fight against disenfranchisement, segregation, labor exploitation, and colonialism. Swindall highlights the cooperation that occurred between progressive activists involved in coalition-building during the Popular Front and also adds to our understanding of the intergenerational nature of civil rights and labor organizing.

Swindall examines the historical and political context of acclaimed African American actor Paul Robeson's three portrayals of Shakespeare's Othello in the United Kingdom and the United States. These performances took place in London in 1930, on Broadway in 1943, and in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1959. All three of the productions, when considered together, provide an intriguing glimpse into Robeson's artistry as well as his political activism.<br /><br /><i>The Politics of Paul Robeson's Othello</i> maintains that Robeson's development into a politically minded artist explicates the broader issue of the role of the African American artist in times of crisis. Robeson (1898-1976) fervently believed that political engagement was an inherent component of the role of the artist in society, and his performances demonstrate this conviction.<br /><br />In the 1930 production, audiences and critics alike confronted the question: Should a black actor play Othello in an otherwise all-white cast? In the 1943 production on Broadway, Robeson consciously used the role as a form for questioning theater segregation both onstage and in the seats. In 1959, after he had become well known for his leftist views and sympathies with Communism, his performance in a major Stratford-upon-Avon production called into question whether audiences could accept onstage an African American who held radical-and increasingly unpopular-political views. Swindall thoughtfully uses Robeson's Othello performances as a collective lens to analyze the actor and activist's political and intellectual development.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "4504520", "name": "Lindsey R.

The second part examines the key ingredients in the American diet throughout time, allowing authors to analyze many of these foods as items that originated in or dramatically impacted the Americas as a whole, and not just the United States. The third part focuses on how these ingredients have been transformed into foods identified with the American diet, and on how Americans have produced and presented these foods over the last four centuries. The final section explores how food practices are a means of embodying ideas about identity, showing how food choices, preferences, and stereotypes have been used to create and maintain ideas of difference.<br /><br />Including essays on all the key topics and issues, The Routledge History of American Foodways comprises work from a leading group of scholars and presents a comprehensive survey of the current state of the field. It will be essential reading for all those interested in the history of food in American culture.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "1138016", "name": "Jennifer Jensen Wallach", "role": "Editor", "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1138016.Jennifer_Jensen_Wallach", "average_rating": "3.68", "ratings_count": "71", "text_reviews_count": "8"}}, "published": "2016", "work": {"id": "46532210", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.tGWvANTTX3dLciH5Ibs53A"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "25731652"}, "isbn": {"@nil": "true"}, "isbn13": {"@nil": "true"}, "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.T9WaleLSHC0mLblM_Q-g5g", "title": "American Appetites: A Documentary Reader", "title_without_series": "American Appetites: A Documentary Reader", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25731652-american-appetites", "num_pages": null, "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "1138016", "name": "Jennifer Jensen Wallach", "role": "Editor", "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1138016.Jennifer_Jensen_Wallach", "average_rating": "3.68", "ratings_count": "71", "text_reviews_count": "8"}}, "published": null, "work": {"id": "45569727", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Ekc84kVu1hLD5RqN4RIXCw"}}]}}}}, "189399": {"GoodreadsResponse": {"Request": {"authentication": "true", "key": "9ri8jiLcNvV2GMvk5HVidg", "method": "author_show"}, "author": {"id": "189399", "name": "Clifford Geertz", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/189399.Clifford_Geertz", "fans_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "113"}, "author_followers_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "113"}, "large_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1250695129p7/189399.jpg", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1250695129p5/189399.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1250695129p2/189399.jpg", "about": "Clifford James Geertz was an American anthropologist and served until his death as professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey.", "influences": null, "works_count": "32", "gender": "male", "hometown": "San Francisco, California", "born_at": "1926/08/23", "died_at": "2006/10/30", "goodreads_author": null, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "330006"}, "isbn": "0465097197", "isbn13": "9780465097197", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "64"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.olFCElzC9aSatGPzeOE0qQ", "title": "The Interpretation of Cultures", "title_without_series": "The Interpretation of Cultures", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/330006.The_Interpretation_of_Cultures", "num_pages": "480", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Basic Books", "publication_day": "19", "publication_year": "1977", "publication_month": "5", "average_rating": "4.10", "ratings_count": "3120", "description": "In <i>The Interpretation of Cultures</i>, the most original anthropologist of his generation moved far beyond the traditional confines of his discipline to develop an important new concept of culture.

What it is instead, however, is less clear. That it might be a kind of writing, putting things to paper, has now and then occurred to those engaged in producing it, consuming it, or both. But the examination of it as such has been impeded by several considerations, none of them very reasonable. One of these, especially weighty among the producers, has been simply that it is an unanthropological sort of thing to do. What a proper ethnographer ought properly to be doing is going out to places, coming back with information about how people live there, and making that information available to the professional community in practical form, not lounging about in libraries reflecting on literary questions. Excessive concern, which in practice usually means any concern at all, with how ethnographic texts are constructed seems like an unhealthy self-absorption--time wasting at best, hypochondriacal at worst. The advantage of shifting at least part of our attention from the fascinations of field work, which have held us so long in thrall, to those of writing is not only that this difficulty will become more clearly understood, but also that we shall learn to read with a more percipient eye. A hundred and fifteen years (if we date our profession, as conventionally, from Tylor) of asseverational prose and literary innocence is long enough.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "189399", "name": "Clifford Geertz", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1250695129p5/189399.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1250695129p2/189399.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/189399.Clifford_Geertz", "average_rating": "4.04", "ratings_count": "4620", "text_reviews_count": "164"}}, "published": "1989", "work": {"id": "640780", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.mg7fgx_SbD7e9Lc1uKAQNA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "479673"}, "isbn": "0226285193", "isbn13": "9780226285108", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "20"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.nD6t_OD5V4xjCGL1gBnoWw", "title": "The Religion of Java", "title_without_series": "The Religion of Java", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/479673.The_Religion_of_Java", "num_pages": "412", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": "Phoenix Edition", "publisher": "University of Chicago Press", "publication_day": "15", "publication_year": "1976", "publication_month": "2", "average_rating": "4.07", "ratings_count": "213", "description": "Written with a rare combination of analysis and speculation, this comprehensive study of Javanese religion is one of the few books on the religion of a non-Western people which emphasizes variation and conflict in belief as well as similarity and harmony.

He then traces the evolution of their classical religious styles which, with disparate settings and unique histories, produced strikingly different spiritual climates. So in Morocco, the Islamic conception of life came to mean activism, moralism, and intense individuality, while in Indonesia the same concept emphasized aestheticism, inwardness, and the radical dissolution of personality.

In this collection of personal and revealing essays, he explores the nature of his anthropological work in relation to a broader public, serving as the foremost spokesperson of his generation of scholars, those who came of age after World War II. His reflections are written in a style that both entertains and disconcerts, as they engage us in topics ranging from moral relativism to the relationship between cultural and psychological differences, from the diversity and tension among activist faiths to \"ethnic conflict\" in today's politics.<br /><br /><br /> Geertz, who once considered a career in philosophy, begins by explaining how he got swept into the revolutionary movement of symbolic anthropology. At that point, his work began to encompass not only the ethnography of groups in Southeast Asia and North Africa, but also the study of how meaning is made in all cultures--or, to use his phrase, to explore the \"frames of meaning\" in which people everywhere live out their lives. His philosophical orientation helped him to establish the role of anthropology within broader intellectual circles and led him to address the work of such leading thinkers as Charles Taylor, Thomas Kuhn, William James, and Jerome Bruner. In this volume, Geertz comments on their work as he explores questions in political philosophy, psychology, and religion that have intrigued him throughout his career but that now hold particular relevance in light of postmodernist thinking and multiculturalism. <i>Available Light</i> offers insightful discussions of concepts such as nation, identity, country, and self, with a reminder that like symbols in general, their meanings are not categorically fixed but grow and change through time and place.<br /><br /><br /> This book treats the reader to an analysis of the American intellectual climate by someone who did much to shape it.

He found that the nineteenth-century Balinese state defied easy conceptualization by the familiar models of political theory and the standard Western approaches to understanding politics.<br /><br />Negara means \"country\" or \"seat of political authority\" in Indonesian. In Bali Geertz found negara to be a \"theatre state,\" governed by rituals and symbols rather than by force. The Balinese state did not specialize in tyranny, conquest, or effective administration. Instead, it emphasized spectacle. The elaborate ceremonies and productions the state created were \"not means to political ends: they were the ends themselves, they were what the state was for....

None, however, will suffice, because in forty years more has changed than those two towns--the anthropologist, for instance, anthropology itself, even the intellectual and moral world in which the discipline exists. And so, in looking back on four decades of anthropology in the field, Geertz has created a work that is characteristically unclassifiable, a personal history that is also a retrospective reflection on developments in the human sciences amid political, social, and cultural changes in the world. An elegant summation of one of the most remarkable careers in anthropology, it is at the same time an eloquent statement of the purposes and possibilities of anthropology's interpretive powers.<br /><br />To view his two towns in time, Pare in Indonesia and Sefrou in Morocco, Geertz adopts various perspectives on anthropological research and analysis during the post-colonial period, the Cold War, and the emergence of the new states of Asia and Africa. Throughout, he clarifies his own position on a broad series of issues at once empirical, methodological, theoretical, and personal. The result is a truly original book, one that displays a particular way of practicing the human sciences and thus a particular--and particularly efficacious--view of what these sciences are, have been, and should become.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "189399", "name": "Clifford Geertz", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1250695129p5/189399.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1250695129p2/189399.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/189399.Clifford_Geertz", "average_rating": "4.04", "ratings_count": "4620", "text_reviews_count": "164"}}, "published": "1996", "work": {"id": "320588", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1._eYtDLRWdvBReo5RE1LtqQ"}}]}}}}, "1926771": {"GoodreadsResponse": {"Request": {"authentication": "true", "key": "9ri8jiLcNvV2GMvk5HVidg", "method": "author_show"}, "author": {"id": "1926771", "name": "Harold Edgeworth Butler", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1926771.Harold_Edgeworth_Butler", "fans_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "author_followers_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "large_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_333x500-46491541e26dbeac15f51487d68dd207.png", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png", "about": null, "influences": null, "works_count": "41", "gender": null, "hometown": null, "born_at": null, "died_at": null, "goodreads_author": null, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1066763"}, "isbn": "1853996793", "isbn13": "9781853996795", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.joP9cRQpG0CU-d_HqOeamQ", "title": "Livy Book XXX (Bcpaperbacks)", "title_without_series": "Livy Book XXX (Bcpaperbacks)", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1066763.Livy_Book_XXX_Bcpaperbacks_", "num_pages": "176", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "publication_month": "10", "average_rating": "3.00", "ratings_count": "5", "description": "Book XXX of Livy s great history of Rome describes the last few years (203-201 B.C.) of the Second Punic War between Rome and Carthage, including Hannibal s final defeat by Scipio at Zama, the conclusion of peace, and Scipio s triumphal return to Rome.This useful edition of the Latin text, reissued after being unavailable for some time, includes an introduction giving background on Livy and his work, Rome and Carthage, the Punic Wars, the African campaign, the Roman army and Scipio s tactics.

The date of his death is nu known, but it was before 100 a.d. He left behind him a treatise On the causes of the decadence of Roman oratory (de causis corruplac eloquenliae), the present work, and a speech in defence of a certain Naevius Arpinianus, who was accused of murdering his wife. These are the only works known to have been actually published by him, ' though others of his speeches had been taken down in shorthand and circulated against his will, while an excess of zeal on the part of his pupils resulted in the unauthorised publication of two series of lecture notes. The present work alone survives. The declamations which have come down to us under his name are spurious. Of his character the Inslilulio Oratorio gives us the pleasantest impression. Humane, kindly and of a deeply affectionate nature, gifted with a robust common sense and sound literary judgment, he may well have been the ideal school master. The fulsome references to Domitian are the only blemishes which mar this otherwise pleasing impression. And even here we must remember his great debt to the Flavian house and the genuine difficulty for a man in his position of avoiding the official style in speaking of the emperor.<br /><br />About the Publisher<br /><br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

Educated at Harvard and the Cambridge Divinity School, he became a Unitarian minister in 1826 at the Second Church Unitarian. The congregation, with Christian overtones, issued communion, something Emerson refused to do. \"Really, it is beyond my comprehension,\" Emerson once said, when asked by a seminary professor whether he believed in God. (Quoted in <i>2,000 Years of Freethought</i> edited by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/140041.Jim_Haught\" title=\"Jim Haught\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jim Haught</a>.) By 1832, after the untimely death of his first wife, Emerson cut loose from Unitarianism. During a year-long trip to Europe, Emerson became acquainted with such intelligentsia as British writer <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/29951.Thomas_Carlyle\" title=\"Thomas Carlyle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thomas Carlyle</a>, and poets <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/64845.Wordsworth\" title=\"Wordsworth\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wordsworth</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11525.Coleridge\" title=\"Coleridge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coleridge</a>. He returned to the United States in 1833, to a life as poet, writer and lecturer. Emerson inspired Transcendentalism, although never adopting the label himself. He rejected traditional ideas of deity in favor of an \"Over-Soul\" or \"Form of Good,\" ideas which were considered highly heretical. His books include <i>Nature</i> (1836), <i>The American Scholar</i> (1837), <i>Divinity School Address</i> (1838), <i>Essays</i>, 2 vol. (1841, 1844), <i>Nature, Addresses and Lectures</i> (1849), and three volumes of poetry. Margaret Fuller became one of his \"disciples,\" as did <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10264.Henry_David_Thoreau\" title=\"Henry David Thoreau\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henry David Thoreau</a>.<br /><br />The best of Emerson's rather wordy writing survives as epigrams, such as the famous: \"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.\" Other one- (and two-) liners include: \"As men's prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a disease of the intellect\" (Self-Reliance, 1841). \"The most tedious of all discourses are on the subject of the Supreme Being\" (Journal, 1836). \"The word miracle, as pronounced by Christian churches, gives a false impression; it is a monster. It is not one with the blowing clover and the falling rain\" (Address to Harvard Divinity College, July 15, 1838). He demolished the right wing hypocrites of his era in his essay \"Worship\": \". . . the louder he talked of his honor, the faster we counted our spoons\" (Conduct of Life, 1860). \"I hate this shallow Americanism which hopes to get rich by credit, to get knowledge by raps on midnight tables, to learn the economy of the mind by phrenology, or skill without study, or mastery without apprenticeship\" (Self-Reliance). \"The first and last lesson of religion is, 'The things that are seen are temporal; the things that are not seen are eternal.' It puts an affront upon nature\" (English Traits , 1856). \"The god of the cannibals will be a cannibal, of the crusaders a crusader, and of the merchants a merchant.\" (Civilization, 1862). He influenced generations of Americans, from his friend <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10264.Henry_David_Thoreau\" title=\"Henry David Thoreau\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henry David Thoreau</a> to <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/42738.John_Dewey\" title=\"John Dewey\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Dewey</a>, and in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1938.Friedrich_Nietzsche\" title=\"Friedrich Nietzsche\" rel=\"nofollow\">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, who takes up such Emersonian themes as power, fate, the uses of poetry and history, and the critique of Christianity.

Our most eloquent champion of individualism, Emerson acknowledges at the same time the countervailing pressures of society in American life. Even as he extols what he called \u201cthe great and crescive self,\u201d he dramatizes and records its vicissitudes.<br /><br />Here are the indispensable and most renowned works, including \u201cThe American Scholar\u201d (\u201cour intellectual Declaration of Independence,\u201d as Oliver Wendell Holmes called it), \u201cThe Divinity School Address,\u201d considered atheistic by many of his listeners, the summons to \u201cSelf-Reliance,\u201d along with the more embattled realizations of \u201cCircles\u201d and, especially, \u201cExperience.\u201d Here, too, are his wide-ranging portraits of Montaigne, Shakespeare, and other \u201crepresentative men,\u201d and his astute observations on the habits, lives, and prospects of the English and American people.<br /><br />This volume includes Emerson\u2019s well-known <i>Nature; Addresses, and Lectures</i> (1849), his <i>Essays: First Series</i> (1841) and <i>Essays: Second Series</i> (1844), plus <i>Representative Men</i> (1850), <i>English Traits</i> (1856), and his later book of essays, <i>The Conduct of Life</i> (1860). These are the works that established Emerson\u2019s colossal reputation in America and found him admirers abroad as diverse as Carlyle, Nietzsche, and Proust.<br /><br />Emerson\u2019s enduring power is apparent everywhere in American literature: in those, like Whitman and some of the major twentieth-century poets, who seek to corroborate his vision, and among those, like Hawthorne and Melville, who questioned, qualified, and struggled with it. Emerson\u2019s vision reverberates also in the tradition of American philosophy, notably in the writings of William James and John Dewey, in the works of his European admirers, such as Nietzsche, and in the avant-garde theorists of our own day who write on the nature and function of language. The reasons for Emerson\u2019s durability will be obvious to any reader who follows the exhilarating, exploratory movements of his mind in this uniquely full gathering of his work.<br /><br />Not merely another selection of his essays, this volume includes all his major books in their rich entirety. No other volume conveys so comprehensively the exhilaration and exploratory energy of perhaps America\u2019s greatest writer.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "12080", "name": "Ralph Waldo Emerson", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1393555704p5/12080.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1393555704p2/12080.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12080.Ralph_Waldo_Emerson", "average_rating": "4.08", "ratings_count": "59947", "text_reviews_count": "2308"}}, "published": "1983", "work": {"id": "47854949", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.JcnCKnBwR_kYhumNSOYTIg"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "3420140"}, "isbn": "0807015563", "isbn13": "9780807015568", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "95"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.5-xjGCH0oZZkHHw_CFnxtQ", "title": "Nature", "title_without_series": "Nature", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1265917261m/3420140.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1265917261s/3420140.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3420140-nature", "num_pages": "160", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Beacon Press (MA)", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "1985", "publication_month": "12", "average_rating": "3.83", "ratings_count": "2988", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "12080", "name": "Ralph Waldo Emerson", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1393555704p5/12080.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1393555704p2/12080.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12080.Ralph_Waldo_Emerson", "average_rating": "4.08", "ratings_count": "59947", "text_reviews_count": "2308"}}, "published": "1985", "work": {"id": "3460613", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.dneNYghn_xT7zkmFWW7F8Q"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "123853"}, "isbn": "014243762X", "isbn13": "9780142437629", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "64"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.426FW8Y7Zp7Z1WxhF8vdfw", "title": "Nature and Selected Essays", "title_without_series": "Nature and Selected Essays", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123853.Nature_and_Selected_Essays", "num_pages": "416", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": "Penguin Classics Edition", "publisher": "Penguin Classics", "publication_day": "24", "publication_year": "2003", "publication_month": "4", "average_rating": "4.14", "ratings_count": "1649", "description": "Through his writing and his own personal philosophy, Ralph Waldo Emerson unburdened his young country of Europe's traditional sense of history and showed Americans how to be creators of their own circumstances.

It demonstrates that artists' documentary use of this medium is a form of social realism, inextricably bound up with politics and ideology.

The key works examined are Keiji Nakazawa's <i>Barefoot Gen</i>, Joe Sacco's <i>Palestine</i>, Marjane Satrapi's <i>Persepolis</i>, W.G. Sebald's <i>Emigrants </i>and Art Spiegelman's <i>Maus</i>.<br /> Innovative techniques, radical methods of depiction, sequence and text organisation are analysed throughout to explain how the authors use visual realism to represent these social crises.

Schodt is an American translator, interpreter and writer.<br /><br />Schodt's father was in the US foreign service, and he grew up in Norway, Australia, and Japan. The family first went to Japan in 1965 when Schodt was fifteen. They left in 1967 but Schodt remained to graduate from Tokyo's American School in Japan, in 1968. After entering the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1970 Schodt returned to Japan, and studied Japanese intensively at International Christian University (I.C.U.) for a year and half. He graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1972, and after a brief bohemian stint at a variety of jobs and traveling became a tour guide in Los Angeles for Japanese tourists, also escorting them to Canada and Mexico. After trying to interpret for a group once at Sunkist, he realized that he could become an interpreter, but needed further training. In 1975, he was awarded a scholarship from Japan's Ministry of Education, to return to I.C.U. and study translation and interpreting. After finishing his studies at I.C.U. in 1977, he began working in the translation department of Simul International, in Tokyo. In mid-1978 he returned to the United States, and since then has worked in San Francisco as a free-lance writer, translator, and interpreter.<br /><br />While working in Tokyo in 1977, he joined with several university friends in contacting Tezuka Productions. They sought permission to translate the Phoenix comic into English.

Schodt has at long last unveiled the fascinating story of 'Professor Risley.' Circus scholars, history buffs, and anyone with an ounce of curiosity should be grateful to him.\"\u2014Dominique Jando, Circopedia.org<br /><br />\"Professor\" Risley (Richard Risley Carlisle) introduced the Western circus to Japan in 1864. Three years later, this former acrobat gave many in the West their first glimpse of Japan when he took his \"Imperial Japanese Troupe\" of acrobats and jugglers on a triumphant tour of North America and Europe. Over the next few years, the Troupe performed before presidents, monarchs, and ordinary citizens. Frederik L. Schodt argues compellingly that such early popular entertainments helped stir a curiosity about all things Japanese that eventually led to japonisme, <i>The Mikado</i>, and, in our time, the boom in manga and anime.<br /><br />Schodt's depiction of Risley and his troupe is enlivened by portraits of the circus demimonde and supported by nineteenth-century photographs, posters, and drawings, many in color. His accounts of these first meetings between Westerners and Japanese shed new light on how different cultures meet, mingle, and influence each other. Descriptions of crowds, dazzling routines, and superstar troupe performers like the famous Little All Right are a delightful revelation to anyone interested in Asia, the circus, and popular entertainment.<br /><br /><b>Frederik L.

Interpol assigns robot detective Gesicht to this most strange and complex case - and he eventually discovers that he too, as one of the seven great robots of the world, is one of the targets.<br /><br />Contains Chapters 40 to 47.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "294649", "name": "Naoki Urasawa", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1247717442p5/294649.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1247717442p2/294649.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/294649.Naoki_Urasawa", "average_rating": "4.40", "ratings_count": "105431", "text_reviews_count": "3846"}}, "published": "2009", "work": {"id": "6665713", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.kK8J3GrmFkXFfWQ7e_Wcww"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "6671875"}, "isbn": "1421532670", "isbn13": "9781421532677", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "46"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.EJ1c8yPOV0sJyhIcARMFYA", "title": "PLUTO: Urasawa x Tezuka, Volume 007 (Pluto, #7)", "title_without_series": "PLUTO: Urasawa x Tezuka, Volume 007", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344747193m/6671875.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344747193s/6671875.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6671875-pluto", "num_pages": "200", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "VIZ Media LLC", "publication_day": "19", "publication_year": "2010", "publication_month": "1", "average_rating": "4.42", "ratings_count": "1800", "description": "Who Killed Astro Boy?

Primarily devoted to critical interpretation and discussion of an author's work, the study not only takes account of major literary trends and important contributions in scholarship and criticism but also provides new critical insights and an original point of view. \"Authors Series\" volumes are rooted in the original works themselves and address readers ranging from advanced high school students to university professors. The book suggests to the informed reader new ways of considering a writer's work. A reader new to the work under examination will, after reading the \"Authors Series\" study, be compelled to turn to the originals, bringing to the reading a basic knowledge and fresh critical perspectives. Lawrence of Arabia was not only a brilliant adventurer, but a brilliant writer. His \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\" is one of the finest British autobiographies of the twentieth century, and this book attempts to show the reader why. \"T.E. Lawrence\" looks carefully at Lawrence's painful search for a cultural and sexual identity, as well as for an artistic form in which to encapsulate his experiences in Arabia. It also discusses what his R.A.F. memoir \"The Mint\" reveals and conceals about his life in the postwar period. It tackles the controversy about his truthfulness, and it probes his search for mystical transcendence. But most of all, \"T.E. Lawrence\" explains why Lawrence is studied; because he had a style at once personal and epic, because hischaracterization of himself and others remains both sharply etched and teasingly obscure, and because he discusses the problems of life, sexuality, politics, and art in a perennially modern way.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "317993", "name": "Stephen Ely Tabachnick", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/317993.Stephen_Ely_Tabachnick", "average_rating": "3.77", "ratings_count": "40", "text_reviews_count": "4"}}, "published": "1997", "work": {"id": "14165847", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.GkYfznS1_K6b2SKdQa1LAQ"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "583229"}, "isbn": "087013552X", "isbn13": "9780870135521", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.VTu6-v1dRXE2MamNDIGo0Q", "title": "Fiercer Than Tigers: The Life and Works of Rex Warner", "title_without_series": "Fiercer Than Tigers: The Life and Works of Rex Warner", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/583229.Fiercer_Than_Tigers", "num_pages": "522", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Michigan State University Press", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "2001", "publication_month": "9", "average_rating": "3.00", "ratings_count": "1", "description": "Fiercer than Tigers: The Life and Works of Rex Warner details the personal and intellectual history of a literary legend of the 1930s and 1940s.

Packed with horror and suspense, D.J. describes the kidnapper as if she were inside his mind and being, feeling with him the demonic urge to steal the little girls as his \"pets,\" and the pain of his own childhood abuse. \"I will take care of her for you Mommy, I will stroke and powder the skin of the precious little pet.

Three other Ripney High School students have already been murdered when Rebecca disappears. Lindsay is drawn into the web of drugs, alcohol, rage and all the dreams that come undone because of them. For four terrible days she delves into the minds of serial killers Mike Hennessey and his pathological sidekick Tony Garrison in a desperate search for Rebecca before she is brutally killed like her classmates.

This book studies the developing role of dialogue in his early writings (1745 to 1754). Diderot's earlier experiments with the dialogue form, meticulously charted and analysed by D. J. Adams, opened the way to the exploration of human communication and cooperation which lies at the heart of the Encyclopedie. At first for Diderot dialogue ended in the triumph of monologue, with one speaker reducing another to silence. But one of his central problems was precisely that of solipsism. Is it possible for people to communicate effectively with each other? By engaging with this problem in his early writings Diderot gradually came to realise the epistemological importance of true dialogue as an escape from the solipsistic trap; and, slowly and hesitantly, he developed the form of communicative dialogue which was to flourish in the masterpieces of his later years.\"", "authors": {"author": {"id": "523165", "name": "D.J.

The Afterlife Revolution triumphantly says that it can. <br /><br />After a near-death experience in 2004, Anne Strieber became an expert in afterlife studies and created an ingenious plan of contact which, to Whitley's amazement, she proceeded to carry out, starting just an hour and a half after she died. <br /><br />As verified by famed afterlife researcher Dr. Gary Schwartz, who wrote the foreword, the Afterlife Revolution is among the most convincing stories of afterlife communication ever told, and is a ringing endorsement not only of the fact that we do not die, but also that the power of love can create an actual bridge between the physical and nonphysical worlds. <br /><br />The book points the way to a new relationship between the living and, as Anne puts it, \u201cwhat you call the dead.\u201d Anne tells of her experience on the other side, saying that \u201cwe are light, alive,\u201d and that \u201cenlightenment is what comes when there is nothing left of us but love.\u201d Her descriptions of the afterlife are brilliantly articulate and nuanced, at once deeply familiar and uniquely her own. <br /><br />The Afterlife Revolution shows how to use basic tools such as what Anne describes as \"objective love\" combined with a simple but special form of meditation to build a relationship between physical and nonphysical worlds. It is intended to help us find that sweet point at which the souls of the living touch those of the dead. As Anne says, \u201cMankind is divided, not so much between the sexes as between the living and what are called the dead. It isn\u2019t natural and it isn\u2019t necessary. We can become whole.\u201d <br /><br />The Afterlife Revolution is about the joy of doing just that, and the magnificent new human experience that will unfold as more and more of us learn to live in this way. <br /><br />\u201cIt has been observed that belief in the afterlife is really a belief in the undying nature of love. In The Afterlife Revolution, Whitley Strieber gives form, story, and insight to that principle, mapping out in vivid, moving, and persuasive detail his continued communion with his beloved wife Anne. Our generation is passing through a renaissance of near and after-death literature. This memoir forms the gravitational center of that field.\u201d \u2013Mitch Horowitz, PEN Award-winning author of Occult America and One Simple Idea: How Positive Thinking Reshaped Modern Life", "authors": {"author": {"id": "18454", "name": "Whitley Strieber", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1435172880p5/18454.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1435172880p2/18454.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18454.Whitley_Strieber", "average_rating": "3.70", "ratings_count": "35010", "text_reviews_count": "2687"}}, "published": null, "work": {"id": "58508377", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ytuUjEXxsI273dXWeYKdBA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "30743241"}, "isbn": {"@nil": "true"}, "isbn13": "9781311601940", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.QnwKsRQ0DRPRmovtBuX2kQ", "title": "The Communion Letters", "title_without_series": "The Communion Letters", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1466786619m/30743241.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1466786619s/30743241.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30743241-the-communion-letters", "num_pages": null, "format": "ebook", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Crossroad Press", "publication_day": "21", "publication_year": "2016", "publication_month": "6", "average_rating": "4.01", "ratings_count": "158", "description": "THE HEART OF THE MYSTERY<br /><br /><br />They are called Others, Visitors, Grays, Friends, or Strangers.

In Rome, a Vatican archaeologist is found dead in St. Peter's Basilica. In Africa, a U.S. senator's son is slain outside a Red Cross camp. The three murders on three continents bear a horrifying connection: all the victims are marked by a Druidic pagan cross burned into their flesh.<br /><br />The bizarre murders thrust Commander Gray Pierce and Sigma Force into a race against time to solve a riddle going back centuries, to a ghastly crime against humanity hidden within a cryptic medieval codex. The first clue is discovered inside a mummified corpse buried in an English peat bog -- a gruesome secret that threatens America and the world.<br /><br />Aided by two women from his past -- one his exlover, the other his new partner -- Gray must piece together the horrifying truth.

Christmas is coming, but there's no deep and dreamless sleep for this little town. Instead, everyone's getting ready to stage the annual Christmas pageant and Nativity play - a weeks-long celebration that brings tourists from around the world who spend enough money to take care of a good one-third of the town budget. That has always come in handy, and in today's recession-torn New England, it's downright essential. There's only one problem. The pageant is religious in nature, and it takes place on public land. One complaint could bring the whole tradition - and the town's finances - crashing down. Fortunately, no one's ever complained. Until now. Tish Verek is an outsider, a true-crime writer who's been dragged away from the city and into the woods by her artist husband. She decides to stir up a little excitement, so she interrupts her current work (a book on children who've committed murder) to announce that she's going to seek an injunction to stop the pageant. Everyone wants her stopped - the local boy who was a famous foreign correspondent, then came back to run the regional weekly; the battered wife who's been given the role of Mary and feels like somebody for the first time in her life; the Vietnam vet with a roomful of guns; the sheriff, who likes to read about big-time detectives like a certain Demarkian fellow; the local minister, whose newer-than-new theology apparently has nothing in it forbidding her to get cozy with another woman's man. Nobody wants Tish to make it to the courthouse that December morning. That's why, when her corpse turns up riddled with rifle fire, there's more than a little sentiment for chalking it up to a huntingaccident. But if it was an honest hunting accident, why hasn't the shooter come forward? And why was an apparently harmless old woman killed exactly the same way on that same morning?

Now, in Spontaneous Happiness, he gives us the foundation for attaining and sustaining optimum emotional health. Rooted in Dr. Weil's pioneering work in integrative medicine, the book suggests a reinterpretation of the notion of happiness, discusses the limitations of the biomedical model in treating depression, and elaborates on the inseparability of body and mind. <br /><br />Dr. Weil offers an array of scientifically proven strategies from Eastern and Western psychology to counteract low mood and enhance contentment, comfort, resilience, serenity, and emotional balance. Drawn from psychotherapy, mindfulness training, Buddhist psychology, nutritional science, and more, these strategies include body-oriented therapies to support emotional wellness, techniques for managing stress and anxiety and changing mental habits that keep us stuck in negative patterns, and advice on developing a spiritual dimension in our lives. Lastly, Dr. Weil presents an eight-week program that can be customized according to specific needs, with short- and long-term advice on nutrition, exercise, supplements, environment, lifestyle, and much more. <br /><br />Whether you are struggling with depression or simply want to feel happier, Dr. Weil's revolutionary approach will shift the paradigm of emotional health and help you achieve greater contentment in your life.<br /><br /><br /><br />", "authors": {"author": {"id": "4401376", "name": "Andrew Weil", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1305822177p5/4401376.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1305822177p2/4401376.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4401376.Andrew_Weil", "average_rating": "3.96", "ratings_count": "20617", "text_reviews_count": "1667"}}, "published": "2011", "work": {"id": "16481868", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.64Lb6ZNTruo1lx8qetkn_w"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "37124"}, "isbn": "0751518557", "isbn13": "9780751518559", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "85"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.N6BayLVU0XA28RL9PboPYg", "title": "8 Weeks to Optimum Health", "title_without_series": "8 Weeks to Optimum Health", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37124.8_Weeks_to_Optimum_Health", "num_pages": null, "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "3.87", "ratings_count": "1926", "description": "The #1 <i>NY Times</i> bestselling book in which one of America's most brilliant doctors shares his program for improving &amp; protecting health. <i>Eight Weeks to Optimum Health</i> lays out Weil's week-by-week, step-by-step plan that will keep the body's natural healing system in peak working order.

It clarifies the mishmash of conflicting news, research, hype, and hearsay regarding diet, nutrition, and supplementation, and further establishes the judicious Dr. Weil, the director of the Program in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona, as a savior of public well-being. If you've ever wondered what \"partially hydrogenated soybean oil\" really is, been perplexed by contrary news reports about recommended dosages for supplements, or questioned the safety of using aluminum pots for cooking, Dr. Weil will make it all clear.<p> Weil (pronounced \"while\") bravely criticizes many of the major diet books on the market, and backs up his admonitions with science. He warns readers to not fall under \"the spell\" of the anticarbohydrate Atkins Diet, but also criticizes the eating plan advocated by Dr. Dean Ornish--which has been granted Medicare coverage for cardiac patients--as being too low fat for the majority of people. (The omega-3 fatty acids missing from Ornish's diet are essential for hormone production and the control of inflammation, he says.) It's also fascinating to learn that autism, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease may be caused by omega-3 fatty acid deficiencies, while an excess of omega-6 fatty acids--very common in the typical American diet--can exacerbate arthritis symptoms. Weil's explanation of the chemistry of fats will prove difficult for most readers, but few will want to eat fast-food French fries ever again after reading his appalling reasons for avoiding them, which go way beyond their well-documented heart-clogging capabilities.</p><p> After a thorough rundown of nutritional basics and a primer of micronutrients such as vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytochemicals, Weil unveils what he feels is \"the best diet in the world,\" with 85 recipes, such as Salmon Cakes and Oven-Fried Potatoes, that are healthy, tasty, quick to prepare, and complete with nutritional breakdowns. He includes a stirring chapter on safe weight loss (he sympathizes with the overweight and comically recalls his one-week trial of a safflower oil-diet while an undergraduate). Other, equally enlightening sections include tips for eating out and shopping for food (with warnings on various additives and a guide to organics), and a wondrous appendix with dietary recommendations for dozens of health concerns, including allergies, asthma, cancer prevention, mood disorders, and pregnancy. <i>Eating Well</i> is an indispensable consumer reference and one not afraid to lambaste the diet industry and empower the public with information about which the majority of doctors--to the detriment of the public health--are ignorant. <i>--Erica Jorgensen</i></p>", "authors": {"author": {"id": "4401376", "name": "Andrew Weil", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1305822177p5/4401376.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1305822177p2/4401376.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4401376.Andrew_Weil", "average_rating": "3.96", "ratings_count": "20617", "text_reviews_count": "1667"}}, "published": "2001", "work": {"id": "1279612", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Ms8r8KdOb5RAfnzhK8HFDg"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "629427"}, "isbn": "0307279499", "isbn13": "9780307279491", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "99"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.MnyJVv0DM918rpcTGwaTEg", "title": "Healthy Aging", "title_without_series": "Healthy Aging", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320486555m/629427.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320486555s/629427.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/629427.Healthy_Aging", "num_pages": "384", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Anchor", "publication_day": "26", "publication_year": "2006", "publication_month": "12", "average_rating": "3.85", "ratings_count": "1067", "description": "Hugely informative, practical, and uplifting. <i>Healthy Aging</i> is infused with the engaging candor and common sense that have made Dr. Andrew Weil our most trusted source on healthy living.<br /><br />EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT:<br /><br />\u2013 The Anti-inflammatory Diet: following Dr. Weil's guide to eating right for a healthy lifestyle<br /><br />\u2013<i> </i>Separating myth from fact about vitamins, herbs, hormones, anti-aging \"medicines,\" and other would-be elixirs of life extension<br /><br />\u2013<i> </i>Mastering exercise, breathing, and stress-management techniques to benefit your mind and body<br /><br />\u2013 Understanding the science behind the aging process<br /><br />\u2013 Sharing life lessons with your loved ones", "authors": {"author": {"id": "4401376", "name": "Andrew Weil", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1305822177p5/4401376.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1305822177p2/4401376.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4401376.Andrew_Weil", "average_rating": "3.96", "ratings_count": "20617", "text_reviews_count": "1667"}}, "published": "2006", "work": {"id": "485143", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.CupB_88nYiT2BMxvDyw61w"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "3065"}, "isbn": "0618479031", "isbn13": "9780618479030", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "41"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.wGDASYM-uEZcjnoBQsFyWA", "title": "Natural Health, Natural Medicine", "title_without_series": "Natural Health, Natural Medicine", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3065.Natural_Health_Natural_Medicine", "num_pages": "448", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Mariner Books", "publication_day": "9", "publication_year": "2004", "publication_month": "12", "average_rating": "4.12", "ratings_count": "647", "description": "The bible of natural medicine\" (Larry Dossey, M.D.), Natural Health, Natural Medicine: The Complete Guide to Wellness and Self-Care for Optimum Health is a comprehensive resource for everything you need to know to maintain optimum health and treat common ailments.

When Rosie calls for chicken, Andy offers a tofu alternative; she likes the flavor of coconut milk, whereas he prefers ground nut milk; when she makes a pastry with butter, he suggests using Spectrum Spread.

Every 2 hours and 24 minutes, someone dies, waiting for a donated organ. Long before organ transplantation became a standard medical practice, doctors knew it would be a solution to the illness and death caused by organ failure. Before they could successfully transplant organs, there were many things they had to learn. They studied the immune system to understand why and how organs were rejected. They learned how to treat the donated organs of people who died suddenly so the organs could be transplanted into another person. They learned how to match the tissue types of the recipient and the donor. Now some scientists are researching the use of embryonic stem cells to create new, healthy tissues and organs.

The procedures used for in vitro fertilization (IVF) can also be used to help parents avoid passing on genetic diseases to their children. IVF has brought joy to thousands of people who could not have had children without it. But some people object to parents using eggs or sperm that are not their own. It has also raised concerns about research on embryos that are no longer needed because the parents have all the children they want.

It is also a social history in its account of the lumbermen\u2019s quest for the last virgin timber and the effects of its depletion. Kenneth L. Smith interviewed more than three hundred people to develop this lively history of the cutting of virgin shortleaf pine forests. The Caddo River Lumber Company and the Arkansas mill towns of Rosboro, Glenwood, and Forester provided jobs and homes for many during the brief heyday of the big sawmills. Smith takes a close look at several important timber companies, and at the personality of T. W. Rosborough, a man who bought and sold vast tracts of land and had an almost fatherly concern for both white and black sawmill workers. The recollections included here provide insight into a population that lived through the Depression years in isolated mountain communities where cats were sometimes sold as possum meat, and where men enjoyed weekend \u201csip and sniff\u201d poker parties.

In 1989, <i>A Year in Provence</i> was published and became an international bestseller. His books have been translated into more than twenty languages, and he was a contributing writer to magazines and newspapers. Indeed, his seventh book, <i>A Year in Provence,</i> chronicles a year in the life of a British expatriate who settled in the village of M\u00e9nerbes. His book <i>A Good Year</i> was the basis for the eponymous 2006 film directed by Ridley Scott and starring actor Russell Crowe.

And in no time he's on the trail of a state-of-the-art art scam, chasing C\u00e9zanne.<br /><br />It's a joy to follow him and the crowds intent on speeding or foiling his quest--including a beautiful agent; a super-savvy art dealer attracted to the finer things in life, especially if they promise the payoff of a lifetime; an awesome Dutch forger; some outstandingly greedy New York sophisticates; and, invisible in the background, the parade of remarkable chefs whose mouthwatering culinary masterpieces periodically soothe the hero and tantalize the reader of Chasing C\u00e9zanne.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "19316", "name": "Peter Mayle", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1236522940p5/19316.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1236522940p2/19316.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19316.Peter_Mayle", "average_rating": "3.87", "ratings_count": "130492", "text_reviews_count": "7565"}}, "published": "1998", "work": {"id": "245911", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.P9zJ4GlfVf0Ua7zK6v8h_Q"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "127671"}, "isbn": "0140261559", "isbn13": "9780140261554", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "211"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1._MnNqY2uEOZE8ZsWdkvNAw", "title": "A Dog's Life", "title_without_series": "A Dog's Life", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1434808281m/127671.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1434808281s/127671.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127671.A_Dog_s_Life", "num_pages": "192", "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "3.82", "ratings_count": "2668", "description": "Boy, an uncannily shaggy canine of unknown origins, and now undisputed master of the Mayle household, recounts his event-filled life in Provence in this unique, rollicking memoir.<br /><br />A pure-bred paranoid labouring under delusions of grandeur, Boy is a character of rich intricacy.

Christianity is more than the interpretation of dogma, or reflection on the Holy Spirit and the scriptures. The person Jesus Christ makes the Church to be one, unites it into a single world community and makes it possible to transcend denominational differences. Pentecostalism is on the verge of becoming something radically new. God is calling His Church to move toward maturity, to demonstrate institutional flexibility, to reveal the power of divine love to mankind, to live the credo of tolerance and care for the world.

It is commonly believed that Christianity was introduced to Japan by the Spanish and Portuguese missionaries during the 1500s; however, Samuel Lee draws on various forms of cultural, religious and linguistic evidence to argue that Christianity was introduced to Japan through the Lost Tribes of Israel, who were converted to Christianity through the missionary efforts of the Assyrian Church of the East around A.D. 500. Much of the evidence he discusses has become submerged into many Japanese folkloric songs, festivals and is to be found in temples. There are, for example, approximately 300 words in Japanese and Hebrew/Aramaic that are similar. Further, Dr. Lee outlines the history of Catholicism in Japan during the 1500s, the systematic persecution of Christians from 1600s to the 1800s, and the rise of Protestant Church in Japan. The historical portion of the book ends with an analysis and discussion of 21st century Japanese society. Lastly, in Rediscovering Japan, Reintroducing Christendom, Samuel Lee questions the missiological methods of Western Christianity and advocates an approach based in dialogue between Christianity and other cultures.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "397133", "name": "Samuel Lee", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/397133.Samuel_Lee", "average_rating": "3.87", "ratings_count": "294", "text_reviews_count": "41"}}, "published": "2010", "work": {"id": "9364463", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.YEVLMF2vvp9eRem0Q6-RTA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "23824365"}, "isbn": {"@nil": "true"}, "isbn13": {"@nil": "true"}, "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.xD2LCblSKJDtjjsin8b0BA", "title": "Luke's Gospel: Luke's Gospel Study Guide", "title_without_series": "Luke's Gospel: Luke's Gospel Study Guide", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23824365-luke-s-gospel", "num_pages": null, "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "5.00", "ratings_count": "1", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "397133", "name": "Samuel Lee", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/397133.Samuel_Lee", "average_rating": "3.87", "ratings_count": "294", "text_reviews_count": "41"}}, "published": null, "work": {"id": "43436721", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.lvg_u-gEzOk8xqJm08pVCA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "17363995"}, "isbn": "9490179140", "isbn13": "9789490179144", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.KgGPWz9-_hR-6jRmckTd4A", "title": "Journey to Grace: A Simplified Survey of the Old Testament", "title_without_series": "Journey to Grace: A Simplified Survey of the Old Testament", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17363995-journey-to-grace", "num_pages": "256", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Foundation University Press", "publication_day": "21", "publication_year": "2013", "publication_month": "1", "average_rating": "5.00", "ratings_count": "1", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "397133", "name": "Samuel Lee", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/397133.Samuel_Lee", "average_rating": "3.87", "ratings_count": "294", "text_reviews_count": "41"}}, "published": "2013", "work": {"id": "24111398", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.50xjPjMMoIl9FMUg_6eyhw"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "28059412"}, "isbn": "1331209056", "isbn13": "9781331209058", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.yM1_juO3LpE46nTeEBlBvA", "title": "Eusebius, Bishop of C\ufffdsarea on the Theophania or Divine Manifestation of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: Translated Into English with Notes, from an Ancient Syriac Version of the Greek Original Now Lost;

The high productivity of the plant also makes it a key target for use as an energy crop. The fiber of the plant is used to generate electricity and produce ethanol as a fuel.<br /><br />Sugarcane is a hybrid of two species, each of which is genetically complex. The high level of genetic complexity in sugarcane creates challenges in the application of both conventional and molecular breeding to the genetic improvement of sugarcane as a sugar and energy crop.<br /><br />This book describes technologies that support the continued use and improvement of sugarcane as source of food and energy. Recent technology developments indicate the potential to greatly increase our understanding of the sugarcane plant by application of emerging genomic technologies.

This is the natural successor to John Hull's useful short critique in Mission- Shaped Church: a theological response, and key authors assess the impact of mission-shaped thinking and practice from a variety of angles. An impressive line up of contributors first asks what counts as a 'fresh expression' and who decides. Part 1 explores what postmodern ways of viewing the world means for the way churches explore truth and uncertainty, and tradition as an evolving rather than a static enterprise. Part 2 uses real examples to examines who attends 'fresh expressions' and what it incarnational theology looks like in practice. Part 3 considers the implications for clergy training and whether there is a case for making 'pioneer ministry' a discrete type.

The thinkers and questions addressed in this book draws us into the heart of a complicated, beautiful, and often tantalisingly unfinished conversation, continuing over centuries and often brushing allusively into parallel concerns in other religions. Raising fundamental matters of epistemology, representation, metaphysics, and divine reality, contributors approach the mystical from postmodern, feminist, sociological and historical perspectives through thinkers such as Meister Eckhart, Thomas Aquinas, Catherine of Siena, Ignatius of Loyola, William James, Evelyn Underhill, Ernst Troeltsch, Rudolf Otto, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Luc Marion and Jean-Louis Chr\ufffdtien.

Not only did these artistic representations provide images through which to find God, but mystical writing, from the early medieval period onwards, is also filled with images of God as artisan crafting a cosmos that likewise refracts and reflects His glory. This collection of essays introduces the currents of thought and practice that underpin this artistic engagement with Western Christian mysticism, and explores the continued link between art and theology.<br /><br /><br /><br />The book features contributions from an international panel of leading academics, and is divided into four sections. The first three sections investigate the interplay between the arts and mysticism from three key vantage points. The final section then offers theoretical and philosophical considerations of mystical aesthetics.<br /><br /><br /><br />The purpose of the volume is to explore this rarely considered yet crucial interface between art and mysticism. It is therefore, an important and illuminating collection of scholarship that will appeal to scholars of Theology and Christian mysticism as much as those who study the Arts and Art History.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "1303744", "name": "Louise Nelstrop", "role": "Editor", "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1303744.Louise_Nelstrop", "average_rating": "3.73", "ratings_count": "11", "text_reviews_count": "0"}}, "published": "2017", "work": {"id": "55882041", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.1NRcNOwJZxi8ShmggyBCuQ"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "30377700"}, "isbn": "1317166698", "isbn13": "9781317166696", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.4iZi6hovWSwX-trZR3NYwQ", "title": "Christian Mysticism: An Introduction to Contemporary Theoretical Approaches", "title_without_series": "Christian Mysticism: An Introduction to Contemporary Theoretical Approaches", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1495246611m/30377700.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1495246611s/30377700.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30377700-christian-mysticism", "num_pages": "288", "format": "ebook", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Routledge", "publication_day": "23", "publication_year": "2016", "publication_month": "5", "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": "This book introduces students to Christian mysticism and modern critical responses to it.

Bishop T. D. Jakes is a breath of fresh air as he shares important principles with every woman desiring to live a more positive and productive life. Take it from me, the material within this book does make a difference.\"<br /><br />--<i>Natalie Cole on</i> <i>The Lady, Her Lover, and Her Lord</i><br /><br /><i>July 1998</i><br /><br />With his bestseller <i>Woman, Thou Art Loosed!</i>, Bishop T. D. Jakes showed women across the country how to heal the emotional scars left by the verbal, sexual, physical, and emotional abuse suffered at the hands of the men in their lives. Now Jakes has written <i>The Lady, Her Lover, and Her Lord,</i> the progressive next step for healing past injuries and moving forward into the future. The hugely popular Pentecostal pastor points out how our society demands women to be sweet, sexy, and submissive. Society demands women to be anything and everything but the one thing God wants them to be: real.<br /><br /> Jakes advises women who want to transform old pain into fuel for future accomplishment and achievement. <i>The Lady, Her Lover, and Her Lord</i> serves as a dialogue between the genders, not a monologue for one gender. Jakes's answer to creating balance and fulfillment in life focuses on the three crucial relationships in a woman's life: with herself, with her man, and with God. Jakes redirects the expectations characteristic of failed relationships by discussing the many things women often want from their man that can be truly fulfilled only by God.<br /><br />Each chapter of <i>The Lady, Her Lover, and Her Lord</i> provides readers with a unique aspect of Bishop Jakes's message. Some examples:<br />* \"Falling in Love with Yourself\": Jakes examines the importance of self-love and the role it plays in our relationships with others.<br />* \"Embracing Someone Else\": a look at the search for a life partner. Jakes points out that we often choose partners because they are physically appealing, only to find out that there is not enough inner attraction to sustain such a relationship.<br />* \"Pillow Talk\": an exploration of what happens to relationships when we become the victim of hateful, thoughtless words, and what that can do to a relationship.<br />* \"Serving the Lord and Making Money\": a look at money, wealth, and financial strength in the Christian life. <br /><br />Jakes concludes by reminding readers of God's capacity when things go wrong.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "72902", "name": "T.D.

It is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains, as does the Bible, the fullness of the everlasting gospel.<br /><br />The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C., and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are among the ancestors of the American Indians. <br /><br />The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come. <br /><br />After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a glorified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and instructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation into the English language. <br /><br />In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and that all who will come unto him and obey the laws and ordinances of his gospel may be saved. <br /><br />Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: \"I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.\" <br /><br />In addition to Joseph Smith, the Lord provided for eleven others to see the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies are included herewith as \"The Testimony of Three Witnesses\" and \"The Testimony of Eight Witnesses.\"", "authors": {"author": {"id": "5158478", "name": "Anonymous", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5158478.Anonymous", "average_rating": "4.15", "ratings_count": "1178863", "text_reviews_count": "63222"}}, "published": "2013", "work": {"id": "2139868", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.F3pY7PWvcSTdFPWPYNvO9Q"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "280111"}, "isbn": "0310902711", "isbn13": "9780310902713", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1486"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.P71-n98BojSSjBLI6wBGNw", "title": "Holy Bible: New International Version", "title_without_series": "Holy Bible: New International Version", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1382581321m/280111.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1382581321s/280111.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/280111.Holy_Bible", "num_pages": "1248", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Zondervan Publishing", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "1985", "publication_month": "2", "average_rating": "4.60", "ratings_count": "54434", "description": "The New International Version is the world's most popular Bible in modern English and is renowned for its combination of accuracy and clarity of language.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "5158478", "name": "Anonymous", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5158478.Anonymous", "average_rating": "4.15", "ratings_count": "1178863", "text_reviews_count": "63222"}}, "published": "1985", "work": {"id": "19119100", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ZDMmq3iS3hFSX5xFfqLqFg"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "19351"}, "isbn": "0141026286", "isbn13": "9780141026282", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1204"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.PFuSko5hfPGr_XmrP5pYVw", "title": "The Epic of Gilgamesh", "title_without_series": "The Epic of Gilgamesh", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19351.The_Epic_of_Gilgamesh", "num_pages": "120", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Penguin Books Limited", "publication_day": "4", "publication_year": "2006", "publication_month": "5", "average_rating": "3.67", "ratings_count": "69021", "description": "<b>Andrew George's \"masterly new translation\" (<i>The Times</i>) of the world's first truly great work of literature<br /></b><br />Miraculously preserved on clay tablets dating back as much as four thousand years, the poem of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, is the world\u2019s oldest epic, predating Homer by many centuries.

Muslims believe the Quran to be verbally revealed through the angel Jibr\u012bl (Gabriel) from God to Muhammad gradually over a period of approximately 23 years beginning on 22 December 609 CE, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632 CE, the year of his death.<br /><br /><br />Muslims regard the Quran as the main miracle of Muhammad, the proof of his prophethood and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam, regarded in Islam as the first prophet, and continued with Suhuf Ibrahim (Scrolls of Abraham), the Tawrat (Torah or Pentateuch) of Moses, the Zabur (Tehillim or Book of Psalms) of David, and the Injil (Gospel) of Jesus. The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in Jewish and Christian scriptures, summarizing some, dwelling at length on others and in some cases presenting alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance, sometimes offering detailed accounts of specific historical events, and often emphasizing the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "5158478", "name": "Anonymous", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5158478.Anonymous", "average_rating": "4.15", "ratings_count": "1178863", "text_reviews_count": "63222"}}, "published": "650", "work": {"id": "632609", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.7sVzBFmjq3WfBbzPHykY3w"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "93101"}, "isbn": "0812972147", "isbn13": "9780812972146", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "677"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.oboXZI0ZvS829yxYPeAwng", "title": "The Arabian Nights", "title_without_series": "The Arabian Nights", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93101.The_Arabian_Nights", "num_pages": "1049", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Modern Library", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "publication_month": "6", "average_rating": "4.05", "ratings_count": "66088", "description": "The tales of told by Shahrazad over a thousand and one nights to delay her execution by the vengeful King Shahriyar have become among the most popular in both Eastern and Western literature, as recounted by Sir Francis Burton.

Craddock was by turns a secular freethinker, a religious visionary, a civil-liberties advocate, and a resolute defender of belly-dancing. Arrested and tried repeatedly on obscenity charges, she was deemed a danger to public morality for her candor about sexuality. By the end of her life Craddock, the nemesis of the notorious vice crusader Anthony Comstock, had become a favorite of free-speech defenders and women's rights activists. She soon became as well the case-history darling of one of America's earliest and most determined Freudians.In <i>Heaven's Bride</i>, prize-winning historian Leigh Eric Schmidt offers a rich biography of this forgotten mystic, who occupied the seemingly incongruous roles of yoga priestess, suppressed sexologist, and suspected madwoman. In Schmidt's evocative telling, Craddock's story reveals the beginning of the end of Christian America, a harbinger of spiritual variety and sexual revolution.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "107773", "name": "Leigh Eric Schmidt", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/107773.Leigh_Eric_Schmidt", "average_rating": "3.77", "ratings_count": "483", "text_reviews_count": "81"}}, "published": "2010", "work": {"id": "14093807", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.4CIHaQ-jx8nODUex0-SmVQ"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1813387"}, "isbn": "0060545666", "isbn13": "9780060545666", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "16"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.rJuKFmdhxYpbrmo6tmzdnQ", "title": "Restless Souls: The Making of American Spirituality", "title_without_series": "Restless Souls: The Making of American Spirituality", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1813387.Restless_Souls", "num_pages": null, "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "3.59", "ratings_count": "70", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "107773", "name": "Leigh Eric Schmidt", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/107773.Leigh_Eric_Schmidt", "average_rating": "3.77", "ratings_count": "483", "text_reviews_count": "81"}}, "published": null, "work": {"id": "1812779", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.QSibBuhnOaSVjXFQyPT3og"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "335948"}, "isbn": "0674009983", "isbn13": "9780674009981", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "4"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.nTEaaDcfmOKfpo0fcD78HA", "title": "Hearing Things: Religion, Illusion, and the American Enlightenment", "title_without_series": "Hearing Things: Religion, Illusion, and the American Enlightenment", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/335948.Hearing_Things", "num_pages": "336", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Harvard University Press", "publication_day": "30", "publication_year": "2002", "publication_month": "11", "average_rating": "3.97", "ratings_count": "37", "description": "\"Faith cometh by hearing\"--so said Saint Paul, and devoted Christians from Augustine to Luther down to the present have placed particular emphasis on spiritual arts of listening. In quiet retreats for prayer, in the noisy exercises of Protestant revivalism, in the mystical pursuit of the voices of angels, Christians have listened for a divine call. But what happened when the ear tuned to God's voice found itself under the inspection of Enlightenment critics? This book takes us into the ensuing debate about \"hearing things\"--an intense, entertaining, even spectacular exchange over the auditory immediacy of popular Christian piety. The struggle was one of encyclopedic range, and <b>Leigh Eric Schmidt</b> conducts us through natural histories of the oracles, anatomies of the diseased ear, psychologies of the unsound mind, acoustic technologies (from speaking trumpets to talking machines), philosophical regimens for educating the senses, and rational recreations elaborated from natural magic, notably ventriloquism and speaking statues. <i>Hearing Things</i> enters this labyrinth--all the new disciplines and pleasures of the modern ear--to explore the fate of Christian listening during the Enlightenment and its aftermath. In Schmidt's analysis the reimagining of hearing was instrumental in constituting religion itself as an object of study and suspicion.

Yet, village atheists--as these godless freethinkers came to be known by the close of the nineteenth century--were also hailed for their gutsy dissent from stultifying pieties and for posing a necessary secularist challenge to majoritarian entanglements of church and state. <i>Village Atheists</i> explores the complex cultural terrain that unbelievers have long had to navigate in their fight to secure equal rights and liberties in American public life.<br /><br />Leigh Eric Schmidt rebuilds the history of American secularism from the ground up, giving flesh and blood to these outspoken infidels, including itinerant lecturer Samuel Porter Putnam; rough-edged cartoonist Watson Heston; convicted blasphemer Charles B. Reynolds; and atheist sex reformer Elmina D. Slenker. He describes their everyday confrontations with devout neighbors and evangelical ministers, their strained efforts at civility alongside their urge to ridicule and offend their Christian compatriots. Schmidt examines the multilayered world of social exclusion, legal jeopardy, yet also civic acceptance in which American atheists and secularists lived. He shows how it was only in the middle decades of the twentieth century that nonbelievers attained a measure of legal vindication, yet even then they often found themselves marginalized on the edges of a God-trusting, Bible-believing nation.<br /><br /><i>Village Atheists</i> reveals how the secularist vision for the United States proved to be anything but triumphant and age-defining for a country where faith and citizenship were--and still are--routinely interwoven.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "107773", "name": "Leigh Eric Schmidt", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/107773.Leigh_Eric_Schmidt", "average_rating": "3.77", "ratings_count": "483", "text_reviews_count": "81"}}, "published": "2016", "work": {"id": "49727101", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Gj7g1vM1prkjlMSD_gDVJA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "580365"}, "isbn": "0691017212", "isbn13": "9780691017211", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "4"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.4vg1nNleG6p_KT8TOCOi8A", "title": "Consumer Rites: The Buying and Selling of American Holidays", "title_without_series": "Consumer Rites: The Buying and Selling of American Holidays", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/580365.Consumer_Rites", "num_pages": "384", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "publication_day": "16", "publication_year": "1997", "publication_month": "11", "average_rating": "3.90", "ratings_count": "40", "description": "In this richly illustrated book that captures both the blessings and ballyhoo of American holiday observances from the mid-eighteenth century through the twentieth, the author offers a reassessment of the \"consumer rites\" that various social critics have long decried for their spiritual emptiness and banal sentimentality.

He is the author of <i>The End of Faith: Religion, Terror and the Future of Reason</i> (2004), which won the 2005 PEN/Martha Albrand Award, and <i>Letter to a Christian Nation</i> (2006), a rejoinder to the criticism his first book attracted. His new book, <i>The Moral Landscape</i>, explores how science might determine human values.<br /><br />After coming under intense criticism in response to his attacks on dogmatic religious belief, Harris is cautious about revealing details of his personal life and history. He has said that he was raised by a Jewish mother and a Quaker father, and he told <i>Newsweek</i> that as a child, he \"declined to be bar mitzvahed.\" He attended Stanford University as an English major, but dropped out of school following a life-altering experience with MDMA. During this period he studied Buddhism and meditation, and claims to have read hundreds of books on religion. In an August 21, 2009 appearance on <i>Real Time with Bill Maher</i>, Harris stated that he grew up in a secular home and his parents never discussed God. He has stated, however, that he has always had an interest in religion.<br /><br />After eleven years, he returned to Stanford and completed a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy. In 2009, he obtained his Ph.D. degree in neuroscience at University of California, Los Angeles, using functional magnetic resonance imaging to conduct research into the neural basis of belief, disbelief, and uncertainty.<br /><br />-<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Harris_(author)\" rel=\"nofollow\">source, plus more info</a>", "influences": null, "works_count": "21", "gender": "male", "hometown": null, "born_at": "1967/04/09", "died_at": null, "goodreads_author": null, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "51299"}, "isbn": "0307265773", "isbn13": "9780307265777", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1471"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.OFlXft4vcYFa5zrCDvFiUw", "title": "Letter to a Christian Nation", "title_without_series": "Letter to a Christian Nation", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51299.Letter_to_a_Christian_Nation", "num_pages": "91", "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "4.03", "ratings_count": "29876", "description": "In response to <i>The End of Faith</i>, Sam Harris received thousands of letters from Christians excoriating him for not believing in God. <i>Letter to A Christian Nation</i> is his reply.

In the aftermath, Harris discovered that most people - from religious fundamentalists to non-believing scientists - agree on one point: science has nothing to say on the subject of human values. Indeed, our failure to address questions of meaning and morality through science has now become the most common justification for religious faith. It is also the primary reason why so many secularists and religious moderates feel obligated to \"respect\" the hardened superstitions of their more devout neighbors.<br /><br />In this explosive new book, Sam Harris tears down the wall between scientific facts and human values, arguing that most people are simply mistaken about the relationship between morality and the rest of human knowledge. Harris urges us to think about morality in terms of human and animal well-being, viewing the experiences of conscious creatures as peaks and valleys on a \"moral landscape.\" Because there are definite facts to be known about where we fall on this landscape, Harris foresees a time when science will no longer limit itself to merely describing what people do in the name of \"morality\"; in principle, science should be able to tell us what we <i>ought</i> to do to live the best lives possible.<br /><br />Bringing a fresh perspective to age-old questions of right and wrong and good and evil, Harris demonstrates that we already know enough about the human brain and its relationship to events in the world to say that there are right and wrong answers to the most pressing questions of human life. Because such answers exist, moral relativism is simply false - and comes at increasing cost to humanity. And the intrusions of religion into the sphere of human values can be finally repelled: for just as there is no such thing as Christian physics or Muslim algebra, there can be no Christian or Muslim morality.<br /><br />Using his expertise in philosophy and neuroscience, along with his experience on the front lines of our \"culture wars,\" Harris delivers a game-changing book about the future of science and about the real basis of human cooperation.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "16593", "name": "Sam Harris", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1274184541p5/16593.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1274184541p2/16593.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16593.Sam_Harris", "average_rating": "3.94", "ratings_count": "151087", "text_reviews_count": "9151"}}, "published": "2010", "work": {"id": "10722133", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.RfjCraPVdrNyWNB9qc8KXw"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "18869177"}, "isbn": {"@nil": "true"}, "isbn13": {"@nil": "true"}, "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "936"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.MGHPg5xpqi3vVstcLYT0dw", "title": "Lying", "title_without_series": "Lying", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18869177-lying", "num_pages": "47", "format": "Kindle Edition", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Four Elephants Press", "publication_day": "23", "publication_year": "2013", "publication_month": "10", "average_rating": "3.85", "ratings_count": "11793", "description": "As it was in Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, and Othello, so it is in life.

A renowned critic of religion, Harris finds the doctrines of Islam dangerous and irredeemable.

Islam and the Future of Tolerance is an exemplar of how the fog can lift when hyperbole and posturing are put aside in pursuit of understanding.<br /><br />Guided by a mutual commitment to the belief that no idea is above scrutiny and no people beneath dignity, Harris and Nawaz challenge each other, and consequently their readers, to defend incompatible positions, define and explore their facts, and discover common ground.

Nor is it known whether religious believers and nonbelievers differ in how they evaluate statements of fact. Our lab previously has used functional neuroimaging to study belief as a general mode of cognition [1], and others have looked specifically at religious belief [2]. However, no research has compared these two states of mind directly.<br />Methodology/Principal Findings<br /><br />We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure signal changes in the brains of thirty subjects\u2014fifteen committed Christians and fifteen nonbelievers\u2014as they evaluated the truth and falsity of religious and nonreligious propositions. For both groups, and in both categories of stimuli, belief (judgments of \u201ctrue\u201d vs judgments of \u201cfalse\u201d) was associated with greater signal in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, an area important for self-representation [3], [4], [5], [6], emotional associations [7], reward [8], [9], [10], and goal-driven behavior [11]. This region showed greater signal whether subjects believed statements about God, the Virgin Birth, etc. or statements about ordinary facts. A comparison of both stimulus categories suggests that religious thinking is more associated with brain regions that govern emotion, self-representation, and cognitive conflict, while thinking about ordinary facts is more reliant upon memory retrieval networks.<br /><br />Conclusions/Significance<br /><br />While religious and nonreligious thinking differentially engage broad regions of the frontal, parietal, and medial temporal lobes, the difference between belief and disbelief appears to be content-independent. Our study compares religious thinking with ordinary cognition and, as such, constitutes a step toward developing a neuropsychology of religion. However, these findings may also further our understanding of how the brain accepts statements of all kinds to be valid descriptions of the world.<br /><br />Author Contributions<br /><br />Conceived and designed the experiments: Sam Harris, Jonas T.

end in Jonestown, Guyana in 1978, where more than 900 Americans committed murder and suicide in a jungle commune. Media coverage of the event sensationalized the group and obscured the background of those who died. The view that emerged thirty years ago continues to dominate understanding of Jonestown today, despite dozens of books, articles, and documentaries that have appeared. This book provides a fresh perspective on Peoples Temple and Jonestown, locating the group within the context of religion in America and offering a contemporary history that corrects the inaccuracies often associated with the group and its demise.<br /><br />Although Peoples Temple has some of the characteristics many associate with cults, it also shares many characteristics of Black Religion in America. Moreover, it is crucial to understand the organization within the social and political movements of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Race, class, colonialism, gender, and other issues dominated the times, and so dominated the consciousness of the members of Peoples Temple. Here, Moore, who lost three family members in the events in Guyana, offers a framework of U.S. social, cultural, and political history that helps readers better understand Peoples Temple and its members.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "18604095", "name": "Rebecca      Moore", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18604095.Rebecca_Moore", "average_rating": "3.84", "ratings_count": "44", "text_reviews_count": "4"}}, "published": "2009", "work": {"id": "6908763", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.8AbmjckkF4k65DWnvtMFyw"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "853802"}, "isbn": "0889468605", "isbn13": "9780889468603", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.7CBjme6rJXXlDPpba9foGg", "title": "A Sympathetic History of Jonestown: The Moore Family Involvement in Peoples Temple (Studies in Religion and Society Vol 14)", "title_without_series": "A Sympathetic History of Jonestown: The Moore Family Involvement in Peoples Temple", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/853802.A_Sympathetic_History_of_Jonestown", "num_pages": null, "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "3.62", "ratings_count": "8", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "18604095", "name": "Rebecca      Moore", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18604095.Rebecca_Moore", "average_rating": "3.84", "ratings_count": "44", "text_reviews_count": "4"}}, "published": null, "work": {"id": "839300", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.fQNbwrLDM674oD7BTa2E8A"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "981501"}, "isbn": "0072870435", "isbn13": "9780072870435", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.OEVjllnByUVuCIDMFc2uQQ", "title": "Voices Of Christianity: A Global Introduction", "title_without_series": "Voices Of Christianity: A Global Introduction", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/981501.Voices_Of_Christianity", "num_pages": null, "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": "Abridged", "publisher": "McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages", "publication_day": "15", "publication_year": "2005", "publication_month": "11", "average_rating": "3.67", "ratings_count": "6", "description": "This new text combines primary source readings with extended introductions that provide historical context for understanding key thinkers and moments in the history of Christianity.

Dante Alighieri was born in the city-state Florence in 1265. He first saw the woman, or rather the child, who was to become the poetic love of his life when he was almost nine years old and she was some months younger. In fact, Beatrice married another man, Simone di' Bardi, and died when Dante was 25, so their relationship existed almost entirely in Dante's imagination, but she nonetheless plays an extremely important role in his poetry. Dante attributed all the heavenly virtues to her soul and imagined, in his masterpiece The Divine Comedy, that she was his guardian angel who alternately berated and encouraged him on his search for salvation.<br /><br />Politics as well as love deeply influenced Dante's literary and emotional life. Renaissance Florence was a thriving, but not a peaceful city: different opposing factions continually struggled for dominance there. The Guelfs and the Ghibellines were the two major factions, and in fact that division was important in all of Italy and other countries as well. The Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor were political rivals for much of this time period, and in general the Guelfs were in favor of the Pope, while the Ghibellines supported Imperial power. By 1289 in the battle of Campaldino the Ghibellines largely disappeared from Florence. Peace, however, did not insue. Instead, the Guelf party divided between the Whites and the Blacks (Dante was a White Guelf). The Whites were more opposed to Papal power than the Blacks, and tended to favor the emperor, so in fact the preoccupations of the White Guelfs were much like those of the defeated Ghibellines. In this divisive atmosphere Dante rose to a position of leadership. in 1302, while he was in Rome on a diplomatic mission to the Pope, the Blacks in Florence seized power with the help of the French (and pro-Pope) Charles of Valois. The Blacks exiled Dante, confiscating his goods and condemning him to be burned if he should return to Florence.<br /><br />Dante never returned to Florence. He wandered from city to city, depending on noble patrons there. Between 1302 and 1304 some attempts were made by the exiled Whites to retrieve their position in Florence, but none of these succeeded and Dante contented himself with hoping for the appearance of a new powerful Holy Roman Emperor who would unite the country and banish strife. Henry VII was elected Emperor in 1308, and indeed laid seige to Florence in 1312, but was defeated, and he died a year later, destroying Dante's hopes. Dante passed from court to court, writing passionate political and moral epistles and finishing his Divine Comedy, which contains the Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. He finally died in Ravenna in 1321.", "influences": "<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/879.Plato\" title=\"Plato\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plato</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/919.Virgil\" title=\"Virgil\" rel=\"nofollow\">Virgil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1127.Ovid\" title=\"Ovid\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ovid</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2192.Aristotle\" title=\"Aristotle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aristotle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/158904.Thomas_Aquinas\" title=\"Thomas Aquinas\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thomas Aquinas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5589950.Boethius\" title=\"Boethius\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boethius</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13755.Marcus_Tullius_Cicero\" title=\"Marcus Tullius Cicero\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marcus Tullius Cicero</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6819578.Augustine_of_Hippo\" title=\"Augustine of Hippo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Augustine of Hippo</a>", "works_count": "752", "gender": "male", "hometown": "Florence", "born_at": "1265/05/14", "died_at": "1321/09/05", "goodreads_author": null, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "15645"}, "isbn": "0812970063", "isbn13": "9780812970067", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1935"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.nxl7fokpB3JDSchP8SwxLg", "title": "Inferno (The Divine Comedy #1)", "title_without_series": "Inferno", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1520255019m/15645.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1520255019s/15645.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15645.Inferno", "num_pages": "490", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Modern Library", "publication_day": "9", "publication_year": "2003", "publication_month": "12", "average_rating": "3.99", "ratings_count": "121250", "description": "Guided by the poet Virgil, Dante plunges to the very depths of Hell and embarks on his arduous journey towards God.

Purgatorio</em> is the second volume in this set and opens with Dante the poet picturing Dante the pilgrim coming out of the pit of hell. Similar to the <em>Inferno</em> (34 cantos), this volume is divided into 33 cantos, written in tercets (groups of 3 lines). The English prose is arranged in tercets to facilitate easy correspondence to the verse form of the Italian on the facing page, enabling the reader to follow both languages line by line. In an effort to capture the peculiarities of Dante's original language, this translation strives toward the literal and sheds new light on the shape of the poem. Again the text of <em>Purgatorio</em> follows Petrocchi's <em>La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata</em>, but the editor has departed from Petrocchi's readings in a number of cases, somewhat larger than in the previous <em>Inferno</em>, not without consideration of recent critical readings of the <em>Comedy</em> by scholars such as Lanza (1995, 1997) and Sanguineti (2001). As before, Petrocchi's punctuation has been lightened and American norms have been followed. However, without any pretensions to being \"critical,\" the text presented here is electic and being not persuaded of the exclusive authority of any manuscript, the editor has felt free to adopt readings from various branches of the stemma. One major addition to this second volume is in the notes, where is found the <em>Intercantica</em> - a section for each canto that discusses its relation to the <em>Inferno</em> and which will make it easier for the reader to relate the different parts of the <em>Comedy</em> as a whole.<br />", "authors": {"author": {"id": "5031312", "name": "Dante Alighieri", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310943198p5/5031312.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310943198p2/5031312.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5031312.Dante_Alighieri", "average_rating": "4.02", "ratings_count": "266320", "text_reviews_count": "9035"}}, "published": "2004", "work": {"id": "2377265", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.HuUu5gPcpuy4ctOoL6AJDw"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "32812"}, "isbn": "0140441050", "isbn13": "9780140441055", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "190"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.ITmpv_dw01IHjI1GLkyOSw", "title": "Paradiso (The Divine Comedy, #3)", "title_without_series": "Paradiso", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32812.Paradiso", "num_pages": "400", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Penguin Classics", "publication_day": "30", "publication_year": "1962", "publication_month": "7", "average_rating": "3.95", "ratings_count": "14065", "description": "Dorothy L.

The answer is that writing keeps me grounded..ok almost grounded... in my sometimes..ok I mean often...chaotic surroundings. Thanks for sharing your books and hopefully you will be able to enjoy some of mine.<br /> I have always loved to read and am passionate about poetry and almost all genres of books. My current goal is to complete my next poetry book and my next novel. I am also a foodie that enjoys all aspects of cooking and that inspired my cookbook series. My children and foster children opened my eyes to the ongoing struggles in the foster system and the world of adoption. My own experience with foster care and adopting 11 wonderful children of different colors inspired me to write books to help others in these areas. Also I love children's literature and am a literacy and biliteracy advocate. That explains a bit about me and why I write in so many genres. It is simply the way my brain is wired. That is the way I work.<br /><br /> Karen Jean Matsko Hood has always enjoyed cooking, baking, and experimenting with recipes. Hood entertains large groups of people and especially enjoys designing creative menus with holiday, international, ethnic, and regional themes.<br /> Hood is publishing a cookbook series entitled the Cookbook Delights Series, in which each cookbook emphasizes a different food ingredient or theme. The first cookbook in the series is Apple Delights Cookbook. Hood is working to complete another series of cookbooks titled Hood and Matsko Family Cookbooks, which includes many recipes handed down from her family heritage and others from more current family traditions. She has been invited to speak on talk radio shows on various topics, and favorite recipes from her cookbooks have been prepared on local television programs.<br /> Hood was born and raised in Great Falls, Montana. As an undergraduate, she attended the College of St. Benedict in St. Joseph, Minnesota, and St. John\u2019s University in Collegeville, Minnesota.

Constructed as a series of character studies, the essays are rooted in autobiographical material with biographical counterpoints, tying the poets distinctly to places. Even as they are placed, however, they are displaced: Rudman's subjects, from D.H. Lawrence to Czeslaw Milosz to T. S. Eliot, are almost all exiles, either geographically or within themselves. This exile spins anger into energy, transmuting emotion into imagination the same way that Passaic Falls, known to William Carlos Williams, turns water into power. The mosaic style of the essays touches on nerve after nerve, avoiding the snags of academic jargon to ease towards an illuminating truth about the artists' shifting work and worlds. Some of the Samuels--Beckett and Fuller--were able to navigate these shifts, while others--Coleridge and Johnson--are shown to be less able to transmute their energy into motion.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "114120", "name": "Mark Rudman", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/114120.Mark_Rudman", "average_rating": "4.13", "ratings_count": "195", "text_reviews_count": "15"}}, "published": "2009", "work": {"id": "6817775", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Nuv8dp6cRbha7AII9O_skA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "6055108"}, "isbn": "1876857706", "isbn13": "9781876857707", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.eRhGSJ934j5VEvXeM4sgaA", "title": "The Motel En Route to Life Out There: Selections from the Rider Quintet", "title_without_series": "The Motel En Route to Life Out There: Selections from the Rider Quintet", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6055108-the-motel-en-route-to-life-out-there", "num_pages": null, "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "5.00", "ratings_count": "1", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "114120", "name": "Mark Rudman", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/114120.Mark_Rudman", "average_rating": "4.13", "ratings_count": "195", "text_reviews_count": "15"}}, "published": null, "work": {"id": "6230996", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.RUoNzKcz6HHhIL-yk5YCNA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "25491777"}, "isbn": {"@nil": "true"}, "isbn13": {"@nil": "true"}, "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.ees2jKe7P2iOnnh9U0Gncw", "title": "Rider: The Rider Quintet, vol. 1 (Wesleyan Poetry Series)", "title_without_series": "Rider: The Rider Quintet, vol. 1", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25491777-rider", "num_pages": null, "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "4.00", "ratings_count": "1", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "114120", "name": "Mark Rudman", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/114120.Mark_Rudman", "average_rating": "4.13", "ratings_count": "195", "text_reviews_count": "15"}}, "published": null, "work": {"id": "45266370", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.bT6vA3rqU56V8FbG5Tq_aQ"}}]}}}}, "58922": {"GoodreadsResponse": {"Request": {"authentication": "true", "key": "9ri8jiLcNvV2GMvk5HVidg", "method": "author_show"}, "author": {"id": "58922", "name": "Yaffa Eliach", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/58922.Yaffa_Eliach", "fans_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "3"}, "author_followers_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "3"}, "large_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1451008856p7/58922.jpg", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1451008856p5/58922.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1451008856p2/58922.jpg", "about": "Yaffa Eliach (b. Yaffa Sonenson, Ei\u0161i\u0161k\u0117s, (Yiddish: \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e7\u200e/Eishyshok) 31 May 1937) is a historian, author, and scholar of Judaic Studies and the Holocaust. She is probably best known for creating the \u201cTower of Life\u201d made up by 1,500 photographs for permanent display at the US Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.<br /><br />Yaffa Eliach was born Yaffa Sonenson to a Jewish family in Eishyshok near Vilna, now Ei\u0161i\u0161k\u0117s, Lithuania, a small town inhabited roughly in equal numbers by Jews and Poles until the Holocaust, where she lived until she was four years old. When the town was occupied by the Germans in June 1941 and most of the Jewish population was murdered by the Germans and Lithuanians, she and her family hid and survived in hiding places in the Eishyshok vicinity. Upon returning to Eishyshok after the arrival of the soviet forces in 1944, her mother and a brother were killed when the village, now occupied by the soviet army and security services (NKVD) was attacked by the Polish Home Army (AK) attempting to liberate Polish soldiers arrested by the soviet occupying forces. The Sonensons were hosting an officer of SMIERSH, soviet counter-intelligence (Yaffa Sonenson's father joined the soviet NKVD forces and helped them fight and arrest the Polish resistance, becoming a levtenant). The Russian officer and several of his soldiers have fired on the arriving Home Army from the Sonensons' house and as a result of a short exchange of fire there were at least three civilian casualties, a Polish woman and two above-mentioned Sonenson's family mambers . Later Yaffa Eliach accused the Polish Home Army of antisemitic motivation of the attack, however, her interpretation was found groundless by Polish historians as well as reputed Israeli scholars, including professor I.Gutman (\"Znak\", July, 2000).<br /><br />Eliach emigrated to Palestine in 1946, and later to the United States in 1954. She received her BA in 1967 and her MA in 1969 from Brooklyn College, New York and a Ph.D. in 1973 from City University of New York in Russian intellectual history, studying under Saul Lieberman and Salo Baron.<br /><br />Since 1969, Eliach was professor of history and literature in the Department of Judaic Studies at Brooklyn College, and founded and served as director of the <i>Center for Holocaust Studies</i> in Brooklyn. She was a member of President Jimmy Carter's Commission on the Holocaust in 1978-79 and accompanied his fact-finding mission to Eastern Europe in 1979. She has been a frequent lecturer at numerous conferences and educational venues and has appeared on television several times in documentaries and interviews. She has written several books and has contributed to Encyclopaedia Judaica, The Women's Studies Encyclopedia, and The Encyclopedia of Hasidism.<br /><br />Eliach has devoted herself to the preservation of memory of the Holocaust specifically from the perspective of a survivor's vantage point. She has also preserved her memories (via lecture) on video and audiocassettes. Her research has provided much material used in courses on the Holocaust in the United States.<br /><br />Eliach thinks her generation \u201cis the last link with the Holocaust\u201d, and considers it her responsibility to document the tragedy in terms of life, not death, bringing the Jews back to life. In memory of her native Eishyshok she has written <i>Once There Was a World: A 900-Year Chronicle of the Shtetl of Eishyshok</i> (1998), recounting the colorful Jewish life of Eishyshok. Also in memory of the town, Eliach created the \u201cTower of Life\u201d, a permanent exhibit which contains approximately 1,500 photos of Jews in Eishyshok before the arrival of the Germans for the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C..<br /><br />In 1953, Eliach married David Eliach, now principal emeritus of the Yeshivah of Flatbush High School. She has a daughter, Smadar Rosensweig, Professor of History at Touro College (NYC), and a son, Yotav Eliach, the principal of Rambam Mesivta High School. She has 14 grandchildren, including Itamar", "influences": null, "works_count": "5", "gender": "female", "hometown": "Ei\u0161i\u0161k\u0117s", "born_at": "1937/05/31", "died_at": "2016/11/08", "goodreads_author": null, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "327496"}, "isbn": "067972043X", "isbn13": "9780679720430", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "22"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.cybNDtSb9mLW3abPcK8rQQ", "title": "Hasidic Tales of the Holocaust", "title_without_series": "Hasidic Tales of the Holocaust", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320462000m/327496.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320462000s/327496.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/327496.Hasidic_Tales_of_the_Holocaust", "num_pages": "267", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Vintage", "publication_day": "26", "publication_year": "1988", "publication_month": "10", "average_rating": "4.30", "ratings_count": "217", "description": "Derived by the author from interviews and oral histories, these eighty-nine original Hasidic tales about the Holocaust provide unprecedented witness, in a traditional idiom, to the victims' inner experience of \"unspeakable\" suffering.

Similarly, his Petits po\u00e8mes en prose (1868; \"Little Prose Poems\") was the most successful and innovative early experiment in prose poetry of the time.<br /><br />Known for his highly controversial, and often dark poetry, as well as his translation of the tales of Edgar Allan Poe, Baudelaire's life was filled with drama and strife, from financial disaster to being prosecuted for obscenity and blasphemy.

This he was to find in Constantin Guys, whom he later celebrated in the famous essay which provides the title-piece for this collection. Other material in this volume includes important and extended studies of three of Baudelaire's contemporary heroes - Delacroix, Poe and Wagner - and some more general articles, such as those on the theory and practice of caricature, and on what Baudelaire, with intentional scorn, called philosophic art. This last article develops views only touched on in Baudelaire's other writings. This volume is extensively illustrated with reproductions of works referred to in the text and otherwise relevant to it.

The prose poem was a medium much suited to his habits and character.

Being an artist and sensualist, he needed a medium that was epigrammatic or aphoristic, but allowed him scope for fantasy and for that element of suggestiveness which he considered essential to beauty. His thinking about society and politics, as about everything else, was experimental; like the thinking of most poets it drew on experience and imagination, rather than on facts and general arguments.

Aujourd'hui reconnu comme un ecrivain majeur de l'histoire de la po\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise, Baudelaire est devenu un classique. Barbey d'Aurevilly voyait en lui \"un Dante d'une \u00e9poque dechue\".

In August 1989, a new, independent organization of young Soviet writers hosted the first international conference for avant-garde writers to be held in the USSR since the Russian Revolution. \"Summer School--Language, Poetry, Consciousness\" was a grassroots attempt to harvest the fruits of glasnost, bringing together poets and scholars from Siberia to San Diego. Attending were four American writers, Michael Davidson, Lyn Hejinian, Ron Silliman, and Barrett Watten. Leningrad is their collaborative account of this extraordinary trip. A collection of poetic essays, it is a commentary on the intellectual revelations that result when post-glasnot Soviet and American intellectuals meet face to face. Some misunderstandings that arise are funny: one Russian asks the Americans if the Manson family is a TV show; some are surprising: when asked if she would like feminist literature from the states, a Russian woman requests the complete poems of Jim Morrison. While each group found inspiration in the other's avant-garde tradition, they had different definitions of what avant-garde was. American writers were testing their ideals of Western Marxism; the Marxists they had admired idealized American bourgeois democracy.

How has the tape recorder changed the poet's voice? What has shopping to do with Gertrude Stein's aesthetics? These and other questions form the core of <i>Ghostlier Demarcations</i>, a study of modern poetry as a material medium. One of today's most respected critics of twentieth-century poetry and poetics, Michael Davidson argues that literary materiality has been dominated by an ideology of modernism, based on the ideal of the autonomous work of art, which has hindered our ability to read poetry as a socially critical medium. By focusing on writing as a palimpsest involving numerous layers of materiality--from the holograph manuscript to the printed book--Davidson exposes modern poetry's engagement with larger historical forces. The palimpsest that results is less a poem than an arrested stage of writing in whose layers can be discerned ghostly traces of other texts.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "308771", "name": "Michael Davidson", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1365980043p5/308771.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1365980043p2/308771.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/308771.Michael_Davidson", "average_rating": "4.45", "ratings_count": "503", "text_reviews_count": "26"}}, "published": "1997", "work": {"id": "1846410", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.xxeCSbtNfpZ-BhRPW84BCw"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "13070774"}, "isbn": "0819569585", "isbn13": "9780819569585", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.esFpkojLS0GLAbJJt4cyEw", "title": "On the Outskirts of Form: Practicing Cultural Poetics", "title_without_series": "On the Outskirts of Form: Practicing Cultural Poetics", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13070774-on-the-outskirts-of-form", "num_pages": "344", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Wesleyan University Press", "publication_day": "15", "publication_year": "2011", "publication_month": "11", "average_rating": "4.33", "ratings_count": "6", "description": "This new book by eminent scholar Michael Davidson gathers his essays concerning formally innovative poetry from modernists such as Mina Loy, George Oppen, and Wallace Stevens to current practitioners such as Cristina Rivera-Garza, Heriberto Yepez, Lisa Robertson, and Mark Nowak.

La prima di queste due raccolte \u00e8 un'invettiva contro il saccheggio e la devastazione del Per\u00f9 e dell'intero continente latinoamericano da parte dei nuovi e vecchi \"conquistatori\". Sono canti violenti e insieme dolcissimi, di rabbia e nostalgia, in cui oltre alla tenerezza e alla malinconia per la condizione del proprio paese, Scorza si scaglia contro i responsabili di questa situazione. Gli \"Addii\", invece, hanno un tono pi\u00f9 sentimentale e sono profondamente legati all'intimit\u00e0 dell'autore, costretto a separarsi da quanto gli \u00e8 pi\u00f9 caro: l'amore di una donna, la giovinezza, la patria.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "166821", "name": "Manuel Scorza", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text":

Difficulties associated with having your heart in Europe and your life in Japan are explored across the shadowy terrains of a world grown decidedly more at risk, dangerous, and violent. The stays of love, friendship, family, place, and memory are tested by death, loss, and displacement; yet Robinson's poetry celebrates all that it can by means of the poet's rhythm, formal dexterity, and his eye for the energized processes of landscape and atmosphere. Composed at the same time as their author began to write and publish aphorisms, these poems show Robinson extending his range of subjects and developing the fresh directness with which he treats them.

The collection brings together a distinguished group of contributors: poets and critics, from several generations, active on both sides of the Atlantic. In a dozen newly commissioned essays they discuss the entire range of Roy Fisher\u2019s work, from its fraught beginnings in the 1950s through such major texts of the 1960s and 1970s as <i>City, The Ship\u2019s Orchestra</i> and <i>Wonders of Obligation</i>, to <i>A Furnace</i>, his 1980s masterpiece, and beyond. The essays are closely engaged with the fabric of Fisher\u2019s verse, but they also bring into view a fascinating array of connections between contemporary poetry and philosophy, psychology; the visual arts and jazz. <i>The Thing about Roy Fisher</i> ends with a full and up-to-date bibliography; an essential starting point for further study of this versatile and complex writer, whose centrality and importance within modern English and European poetry is now more than ever apparent. Kerrigan and Robinson\u2019s collection provides a helpful introduction to Roy Fisher\u2019s work, and will be necessary reading for anyone with a live interest in modern poetry.<br /><br />\"If you haven\u2019t been introduced before, meet Roy Fisher; a major figure of twentieth century literature-inventive, exciting and unpredictable.\"\u2014Eleanor Cooke, <i>Raw Edge</i><br /><br />\"Roy Fisher\u2019s work is something altogether rare in contemporary British poetry.\"\u2014David Sexton, <i>The Sunday Times</i>", "authors": {"author": {"id": "2937713", "name": "Peter     Robinson", "role": "Editor", "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2937713.Peter_Robinson", "average_rating": "3.95", "ratings_count": "44", "text_reviews_count": "7"}}, "published": "2000", "work": {"id": "593109", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.2s_spEzHkfXEECKr5jC-lQ"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "34697294"}, "isbn": "4907359187", "isbn13": "9784907359188", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.yJUYPaACkuLmuOPJFgPaSA", "title": "Approach to Distance: Selected Poems from Japan", "title_without_series": "Approach to Distance: Selected Poems from Japan", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1490837609m/34697294.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1490837609s/34697294.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34697294-approach-to-distance", "num_pages": null, "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Isobar Press", "publication_day": "20", "publication_year": "2017", "publication_month": "3", "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": "Peter Robinson (1953- ) is among Britain's internationally recognized contemporary poets.

Here are his dialogues with Italian poetry and culture, and unforeseen encounters with Japan, all in relation to the historical vicissitudes of his home country, and the landscapes in a much-revisited Liverpool. <em>For the Small Mercies</em>, published here for the first time, completes a triptych of books written since Robinson's return after nearly two decades of working in Kyoto and Sendai, a return that, coinciding with the global financial crisis and onset of austerity culture, provided occasions for further reflections on the economic motifs of his earliest poems.<br /><br />Peter Robinson was called 'the finest poet of his generation' with the publication of <em>Overdrawn Account </em>(1980), and <em>This Other Life</em> (1988) was awarded the Cheltenham Prize. He has also been the recipient of the John Florio Prize in 2008, and two Poetry Book Society Recommendations. Described by Adam Piette as 'the finest poet alive' on the basis of his 'astonishingly finely-tuned gauge for recording the pressures and processes that generate lived occasions', his work was characterized by Roy Fisher as like 'a listening device, alert for the moments when the tectonic plates of mental experience slide quietly one beneath another to create paradoxes and complexities that call for poems to be made.'

To these has been added a gathering of memoirs written for various occasions over thirty years. Among these is 'Lost and Found', an account of the events surrounding the discovery he was suffering from a brain tumour, and how after its removal he was able to return to Sendai, working there for a further twelve years.

The reputation of her more flamboyant and accessible friend and countryman Pablo Neruda has overshadowed hers, and she has been officially sentimentalised into a 'poetess' of children and motherhood. Translations, and even selections of her work in Spanish, have tended to underplay the darkness, the strangeness, and the raging intensity of her poems of grief and pain, the yearning power of her evocations of the Chilean landscape, the stark music of her Round Dances, the visionary splendour of her Hymns of America. During her lifetime Mistral published four books: Desolation, Tenderness, Clearcut, and Winepress. These are included in the 'Complete' Nobel edition published in Madrid; the Poem of Chile, her last book, was printed years after her death.

This jam-packed how-to by a former Marvel Comics cartoonist offers everything a budding artist needs.</b><br /><br />Written and illustrated by a former Marvel Comics\u2019 artist with brilliant hand-done images throughout, this graphic handbook of cartooning is without equal. It's simply larger, better illustrated, and more in depth than any similar title on the market. In elaborate detail, it focuses on superheroes and their atmospheric world filled with speed and movement. Every aspect of creating cartoons is taught: the supplies, developing mood, and the techniques that endow characters with personality. See how to draw a variety of faces (female, heroic, cute, gaunt), and give the appearance of age.

But if the digital has created a \"paradigm shift\" for architecture, which paradigm is shifting? In <i>The Alphabet and the Algorithm</i>, Mario Carpo points to one key practice of modernity: the making of identical copies. Carpo highlights two examples of identicality crucial to the shaping of architectural modernity: in the fifteenth century, Leon Battista Alberti's invention of architectural design, according to which a building is an identical copy of the architect's design; and, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the mass production of identical copies from mechanical master models, matrixes, imprints, or molds. The modern power of the identical, Carpo argues, came to an end with the rise of digital technologies. Everything digital is variable. In architecture, this means the end of notational limitations, of mechanical standardization, and of the Albertian, authorial way of building by design. Charting the rise and fall of the paradigm of identicality, Carpo compares new forms of postindustrial digital craftsmanship to hand-making and the cultures and technologies of variations that existed before the coming of machine-made, identical copies. Carpo reviews the unfolding of digitally based design and construction from the early 1990s to the present, and suggests a new agenda for architecture in an age of variable objects and of generic and participatory authorship.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "69079", "name": "Mario Carpo", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/69079.Mario_Carpo", "average_rating": "4.02", "ratings_count": "88", "text_reviews_count": "7"}}, "published": "2011", "work": {"id": "15711143", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.2JkyR6RupYuWCfm4_rC-0A"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "36574279"}, "isbn": {"@nil": "true"}, "isbn13": {"@nil": "true"}, "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.QH5b4htFjmYwIOTOMDUU1A", "title": "The Second Digital Turn: Design Beyond Intelligence", "title_without_series": "The Second Digital Turn: Design Beyond Intelligence", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36574279-the-second-digital-turn", "num_pages": null, "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "4.33", "ratings_count": "12", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "69079", "name": "Mario Carpo", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/69079.Mario_Carpo", "average_rating": "4.02", "ratings_count": "88", "text_reviews_count": "7"}}, "published": null, "work": {"id": "58316408", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.argCmdhtaZPBovfRj7Yvtw"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "119175"}, "isbn": "0262032880", "isbn13": "9780262032889", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.nk7P5TcgdKmjfhrBN9i7ww", "title": "Architecture in the Age of Printing: Orality, Writing, Typography, and Printed Images in the History of Architectural Theory", "title_without_series": "Architecture in the Age of Printing: Orality, Writing, Typography, and Printed Images in the History of Architectural Theory", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119175.Architecture_in_the_Age_of_Printing", "num_pages": "254", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Mit Press", "publication_day": "27", "publication_year": "2001", "publication_month": "6", "average_rating": "4.10", "ratings_count": "10", "description": "<b>A history of the influence of communication technologies on Western architectural theory.</b><br /><br />The discipline of architecture depends on the transmission in space and time of accumulated experiences, concepts, rules, and models. From the invention of the alphabet to the development of ASCII code for electronic communication, the process of recording and transmitting this body of knowledge has reflected the dominant information technologies of each period. In this book Mario Carpo discusses the communications media used by Western architects, from classical antiquity to modern classicism, showing how each medium related to specific forms of architectural thinking.<br /><br />Carpo highlights the significance of the invention of movable type and mechanically reproduced images. He argues that Renaissance architectural theory, particularly the system of the five architectural orders, was consciously developed in response to the formats and potential of the new printed media. Carpo contrasts architecture in the age of printing with what preceded it: Vitruvian theory and the manuscript format, oral transmission in the Middle Ages, and the fifteenth-century transition from script to print. He also suggests that the basic principles of \"typographic\" architecture thrived in the Western world as long as print remained our main information technology. The shift from printed to digital representations, he points out, will again alter the course of architecture.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "69079", "name": "Mario Carpo", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/69079.Mario_Carpo", "average_rating": "4.02", "ratings_count": "88", "text_reviews_count": "7"}}, "published": "2001", "work": {"id": "114737", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.f8AKLlO0bfZaILtfy6tpJA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "15869261"}, "isbn": "1119951747", "isbn13": "9781119951742", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.vtJQs8vy3Jv7JYqNgv8Qnw", "title": "The Digital Turn in Architecture 1992 - 2012", "title_without_series": "The Digital Turn in Architecture 1992 - 2012", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355079106m/15869261.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355079106s/15869261.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15869261-the-digital-turn-in-architecture-1992---2012", "num_pages": "264", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Wiley", "publication_day": "26", "publication_year": "2012", "publication_month": "12", "average_rating": "3.75", "ratings_count": "8", "description": "Now almost 20 years old, the digital turn in architecture hasalready gone through several stages and phases. <i>ArchitecturalDesign</i> (<i>AD</i>) has captured them all - from foldingto cyberspace, nonlinearity and hypersurfaces, from versioning toscripting, emergence, information modelling and parametricism.

Inspired by the popular Japanese character style (<i>kawaii </i>means \u201ccute\u201d), all of the subjects in this sketchbook are rendered in ballpoint pen, a ubiquitous office supply item that doesn\u2019t bleed through the page and allows you to create small details and sharp lines.

Her Mythic Being performances critically engaged with popular representations of race, gender, sexuality, and class; they challenged viewers to accept personal responsibility for xenophobia and discrimination and the conditions that allowed them to persist. Piper\u2019s work confronts viewers and forces them to reconsider assumptions about the social construction of identity. <i>Adrian Piper: Race, Gender, and Embodiment</i> is an in-depth analysis of this pioneering artist\u2019s work, illustrated with more than ninety images, including twenty-one in color.Over the course of a decade, John P. Bowles and Piper conversed about her art and its meaning, reception, and relation to her scholarship on Kant\u2019s philosophy. Drawing on those conversations, Bowles locates Piper\u2019s work at the nexus of Conceptual and feminist art of the late 1960s and 1970s. Piper was the only African American woman associated with the Conceptual artists of the 1960s and one of only a few African Americans to participate in exhibitions of the nascent feminist art movement in the early 1970s. Bowles contends that Piper\u2019s work is ultimately about our responsibility for the world in which we live.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "4686354", "name": "John P.

In The Culture of Violence, Francis Barker takes a different view.<br /><br />Central to his argument is the contention that, contrary to post-Enlightenment humanist, liberal and conservative thought, 'culture' does not necessarily stand in opposition to political inequality and social injustice, but may be complicit with the oppressive exercise of power.<br /><br />The book focuses on Shakespearean tragedy and on the historicism and culturalism of much present-day cultural theory. Barker's analysis moves dialectically backwards and forwards between these two moments in order to illuminate aspects of early modern culture, and to critique the ways in which the complicity between culture and violence has been occluded. Rejecting the tendency of both modernism and post-modernism to homogenise historical time, Barker argues for a genuinely new, 'diacritical' understanding of the violence of history.<br />", "authors": {"author": {"id": "183863", "name": "Francis Barker", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/183863.Francis_Barker", "average_rating": "3.68", "ratings_count": "72", "text_reviews_count": "7"}}, "published": "1994", "work": {"id": "1526286", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.CQc6VCmtEAcR7_brynASRw"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "18790478"}, "isbn": "1136492356", "isbn13": "9781136492358", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.mTPH_69kZl2ZMzBwQPTpig", "title": "Literature Politics & Theory", "title_without_series": "Literature Politics & Theory", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18790478-literature-politics-theory", "num_pages": "288", "format": "ebook", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Routledge", "publication_day": "8", "publication_year": "2013", "publication_month": "10", "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": "First Published in 2002.

Given the lack of biographical material on Shakespeare and the consequent mystery surrounding his intentions, attention is focused on the relationship between the play and its potential audience. Through this approach an unusual thesis is developed, one in which the play is seen as casting a positive light on the Essex conspiracy and the future succession of James I. This is a fascinating and controversial study that will be of value to anyone with an interest in Shakespeare, Elizabethan and Jacobean history, or literary criticism.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "602313", "name": "Lilian Winstanley", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/602313.Lilian_Winstanley", "average_rating": "3.18", "ratings_count": "17", "text_reviews_count": "3"}}, "published": "2012", "work": {"id": "19466707", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.pDfYUZoYXO_Z--KyjEEzJA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "9475123"}, "isbn": {"@nil": "true"}, "isbn13": {"@nil": "true"}, "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.7jb_HIUs62dvHlQxxnj8IA", "title": "The Faerie Queene (Book 1)", "title_without_series": "The Faerie Queene", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9475123-the-faerie-queene", "num_pages": "293", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publication_day": null, "publication_year": "1920", "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "3.00", "ratings_count": "1", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "602313", "name": "Lilian Winstanley", "role": "Ed.", "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/602313.Lilian_Winstanley", "average_rating": "3.18", "ratings_count": "17", "text_reviews_count": "3"}}, "published": "1920", "work": {"id": "14360296", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.unlvr3IQYkgu4HpviAz56g"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "26692285"}, "isbn": "1298768691", "isbn13": "9781298768698", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.Rbf16AwSOLJzR2ObtlcuFw", "title": "Macbeth, King Lear & Contemporary History; Being a Study of the Relations of the Play of Macbeth to the Personal History of James I, the Darnley Murder and the St. Bartholomew Massacre and Also of King Lear as Symbolic Mythology", "title_without_series": "Macbeth, King Lear & Contemporary History; Being a Study of the Relations of the Play of Macbeth to the Personal History of James I, the Darnley Murder and the St. Bartholomew Massacre and Also of King Lear as Symbolic Mythology", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1444653083m/26692285.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1444653083s/26692285.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26692285-macbeth-king-lear-contemporary-history-being-a-study-of-the-relation", "num_pages": "238", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Andesite Press", "publication_day": "12", "publication_year": "2015", "publication_month": "8", "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": "This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

He proposes an original theoretical relation between a generative and consistent tragic ground and complex characterization patterns.

Basing his theory in the sparagmos, the dismembering rite associated with Dionysus, Storm identifies a rending tendency that transcends the ancient Greek setting and can be recognized transhistorically. The dramatic character in any era who suffers the tragic fate must do so in the manner of the ancient god of theater: the depicted self is torn apart, figuratively if not literally, psychologically if not physically.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "660290", "name": "William Storm", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/660290.William_Storm", "average_rating": "3.00", "ratings_count": "3", "text_reviews_count": "0"}}, "published": "1998", "work": {"id": "1386011", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.78sqV0yDLoiKF9D-HVrkDA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "28148232"}, "isbn": "1107145759", "isbn13": "9781107145757", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.XsLTIHPZ7NA4jRViz_b3cg", "title": "Dramaturgy and Dramatic Character: A Long View", "title_without_series": "Dramaturgy and Dramatic Character: A Long View", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1457292895m/28148232.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1457292895s/28148232.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28148232-dramaturgy-and-dramatic-character", "num_pages": "250", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publication_day": "17", "publication_year": "2016", "publication_month": "3", "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": "Dramatic character is among the most long-standing and familiar of artistic phenomena. From the theatre of Dionysus in ancient Greece to the modern stage, William Storm's book delivers a wide-ranging view of how characters have been conceived at pivotal moments in history. Storm reaffirms dramatic character as not only ancestrally prominent but as a continuing focus of interest. He looks closely at how stage figures compare to fictional characters in books, dramatic media, and other visual arts. Emphasis is sustained throughout on fundamental questions of how theatrical characterization relates to dramatic structure, style, and genre. Extensive attention is given to how characters think and to aspects of agency, selfhood, and consciousness.

Yet irony today, in aesthetic, literary and philosophical contexts especially, is often regarded with skepticism - as ungraspable, or elusive to the point of confounding. Countering this tendency, Storm advocates a wide-angle view of this master trope, exploring the ironic in major works by playwrights including Chekhov, Pirandello and Brecht, and in notable relation to well-known representative characters in drama from Ibsen's Halvard Solness to Stoppard's Septimus Hodge and Wasserstein's Heidi Holland. To the degree that irony is existential, its presence in the theatre relates directly to the circumstances and the expressiveness of the characters on stage. This study investigates how these key figures enact, embody, represent and personify the ironic in myriad situations in the modern and contemporary theatre.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "660290", "name": "William Storm", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/660290.William_Storm", "average_rating": "3.00", "ratings_count": "3", "text_reviews_count": "0"}}, "published": "2011", "work": {"id": "23265665", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.SkMUzx9Dp1jcpIzBA_6B0Q"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "15016714"}, "isbn": "0982229356", "isbn13": "9780982229354", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.mBX1lfLklxlygtadaTs2eQ", "title": "Tadamasa", "title_without_series": "Tadamasa", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15016714-tadamasa", "num_pages": null, "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "660290", "name": "William Storm", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/660290.William_Storm", "average_rating": "3.00", "ratings_count": "3", "text_reviews_count": "0"}}, "published": null, "work": {"id": "20671281", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.cSnH7ZzxYZ2e-S3CCt85fQ"}}]}}}}, "585": {"GoodreadsResponse": {"Request": {"authentication": "true", "key": "9ri8jiLcNvV2GMvk5HVidg", "method": "author_show"}, "author": {"id": "585", "name": "John Steinbeck", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/585.John_Steinbeck", "fans_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "14822"}, "author_followers_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "14822"}, "large_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1182118389p7/585.jpg", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1182118389p5/585.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1182118389p2/585.jpg", "about": "John Steinbeck III was an American writer. He wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Grapes of Wrath, published in 1939 and the novella Of Mice and Men, published in 1937. In all, he wrote twenty-five books, including sixteen novels, six non-fiction books and several collections of short stories. <br /><br />In 1962 Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature.<br /><br />Steinbeck grew up in the Salinas Valley region of California, a culturally diverse place of rich migratory and immigrant history. This upbringing imparted a regionalistic flavor to his writing, giving many of his works a distinct sense of place. <br /><br />Steinbeck moved briefly to New York City, but soon returned home to California to begin his career as a writer. Most of his earlier work dealt with subjects familiar to him from his formative years. An exception was his first novel Cup of Gold which concerns the pirate Henry Morgan, whose adventures had captured Steinbeck's imagination as a child.<br /><br />In his subsequent novels, Steinbeck found a more authentic voice by drawing upon direct memories of his life in California. Later he used real historical conditions and events in the first half of 20th century America, which he had experienced first-hand as a reporter. <br /><br />Steinbeck often populated his stories with struggling characters; his works examined the lives of the working class and migrant workers during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. His later body of work reflected his wide range of interests, including marine biology, politics, religion, history, and mythology. <br /><br />One of his last published works was Travels with Charley, a travelogue of a road trip he took in 1960 to rediscover America. He died in 1968 in New York of a heart attack and his ashes are interred in Salinas.<br /><br />Seventeen of his works, including The Grapes of Wrath (1940), Cannery Row (1945), The Pearl (1947), and East of Eden (1952), went on to become Hollywood films, and Steinbeck also achieved success as a Hollywood writer, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Story in 1944 for Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat.", "influences": "Ed Ricketts, Will Lang, Socrates, Emiliano Zapata, Lincoln Steffens, Arthur Miller", "works_count": "306", "gender": "male", "hometown": "Salinas Valley, California", "born_at": "1902/02/27", "died_at": "1968/12/20", "goodreads_author": null, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "890"}, "isbn": "0142000671", "isbn13": "9780142000670", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "22949"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.qtwvMU3sqr2Wph0NOU770w", "title": "Of Mice and Men", "title_without_series": "Of Mice and Men", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1511302904m/890.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1511302904s/890.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/890.Of_Mice_and_Men", "num_pages": "112", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": "Steinbeck Centennial Edition, US / CAN Edition", "publisher": "Penguin Books", "publication_day": "8", "publication_year": "2002", "publication_month": "1", "average_rating": "3.85", "ratings_count": "1667796", "description": "The compelling story of two outsiders striving to find their place in an unforgiving world.

The town is important because it is a port that serves a large coal mine. Colonel Lanser, the head of the invading battalion, along with his staff establishes his HQ in the house of the democratically elected and popular Mayor Orden.<br /><br />As the reality of occupation sinks in and the weather turns bleak, with the snows beginning earlier than usual, the \"simple, peaceful people\" of the town are angry and confused. Colonel Lanser, a veteran of many wars, tries to operate under a veil of civility and law, but in his heart he knows that \"there are no peaceful people\" amongst those whose freedom has been taken away by force. The veil is soon torn apart when Alexander Morden, an erstwhile alderman and \"a free man,\" is ordered to work in the mine. He strikes out at Captain Loft with a pick axe, but Captain Bentick steps into its path and dies of it. After a summary trial, Morden is executed by a firing squad. This incident catalyzes the people of the town and they settle into \"a slow, silent, waiting revenge.\" Sections of the railroad linking the port with the mine get damaged regularly, the machinery breaks down often, and the dynamo of the electricity generators gets short circuited. Whenever a soldier relaxes his guard, drinks or goes out with a woman, he is killed. Mayor Orden stands by his people, and tries to explain to Col. Lanser that his goal \u2013 \"to break man\u2019s spirit permanently\" \u2013 is impossible.<br /><br />The cold weather and the constant fear weighs heavy on the occupying force, many of whom wish the war to end so that they can return home. They realize the futility of the war and that \"the flies have conquered the flypaper.\" Some members of the resistance escape to England and ask the English for explosives so that the townspeople can intensify their efforts. English planes parachute-drop small packages containing dynamite sticks and chocolates all around the town. In a state of panic, the army takes the Mayor and his friend Dr. Winter, the town doctor and historian, hostage and lets it be known that any action from resistance will lead to their execution. Mayor Orden knows that nothing can stop his people and that his death is imminent. He tells his wife that while he can be killed, the idea of Mayor (and freedom and democracy) is beyond the reach of any army. Before his execution, Mayor Orden reminds Dr. Winter of the dialogues of Socrates in the Apology, a part he played in the high school play, and tells him to make sure that the debt is repaid to the army, i.e., that the resistance is continued.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "585", "name": "John Steinbeck", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1182118389p5/585.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1182118389p2/585.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/585.John_Steinbeck", "average_rating": "3.92", "ratings_count": "3205249", "text_reviews_count": "88270"}}, "published": "2000", "work": {"id": "21887652", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.uGHyoO_eA7r_1_-DP8dTGg"}}]}}}}, "355791": {"GoodreadsResponse": {"Request": {"authentication": "true", "key": "9ri8jiLcNvV2GMvk5HVidg", "method": "author_show"}, "author": {"id": "355791", "name": "Alexander Leggatt", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/355791.Alexander_Leggatt", "fans_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "author_followers_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "large_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_333x500-a9c67bed07ee7e10983a5d5ccc572516.png", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png", "about": null, "influences": null, "works_count": "25", "gender": "male", "hometown": "Oakville", "born_at": "1940/08/18", "died_at": null, "goodreads_author": null, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1187983"}, "isbn": "0521779421", "isbn13": "9780521779425", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "4"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.p8mu_KoZl3njuCkON8pOeQ", "title": "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespearean Comedy", "title_without_series": "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespearean Comedy", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1187983.The_Cambridge_Companion_to_Shakespearean_Comedy", "num_pages": "256", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publication_day": "19", "publication_year": "2011", "publication_month": "5", "average_rating": "3.32", "ratings_count": "22", "description": "This introduction examines the continuity and variety of Shakepeare's work and the creative use he made of his inherited conventions.

Written in a clear, accessible style, it highlights the humanistic aspects of Shakespearean tragedy.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "355791", "name": "Alexander Leggatt", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/355791.Alexander_Leggatt", "average_rating": "3.49", "ratings_count": "78", "text_reviews_count": "10"}}, "published": "2015", "work": {"id": "3289286", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.6l1PGHzzodhAbpJ84y9ctg"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "4722656"}, "isbn": "0415006554", "isbn13": "9780415006552", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.fS_3lEl0FERDdzwwHI0S6w", "title": "Shakespeare's Political Drama: The History Plays And The Roman Plays", "title_without_series": "Shakespeare's Political Drama: The History Plays And The Roman Plays", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4722656-shakespeare-s-political-drama", "num_pages": "266", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Routledge", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "1988", "publication_month": "1", "average_rating": "3.75", "ratings_count": "4", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "355791", "name": "Alexander Leggatt", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/355791.Alexander_Leggatt", "average_rating": "3.49", "ratings_count": "78", "text_reviews_count": "10"}}, "published": "1988", "work": {"id": "4787102", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.pBGrxi_WPmZzWiW4ymzc5Q"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "5550510"}, "isbn": "0582493110", "isbn13": "9780582493117", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.NRzvssgoJao_p7kFkziNOw", "title": "English Drama: Shakespeare to the Restoration 1590-1660", "title_without_series": "English Drama: Shakespeare to the Restoration 1590-1660", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1393219189m/5550510.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1393219189s/5550510.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5550510-english-drama", "num_pages": "310", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Routledge", "publication_day": "9", "publication_year": "1988", "publication_month": "3", "average_rating": "3.00", "ratings_count": "2", "description": "The most important period in the history of English drama is revealed in Alexander Leggatt's challenging account.

Most studies of the period focus on major authors; this one follows recurring themes and motifs, through a variety of plays by many authors from the moralizing comedies of the boys' companies. Professor Leggatt provides not only a fresh perspective on familiar plays by such figures as Jonson, Middleton, and Dekker, but also a new look at a number of neglected comedies, some by unfamiliar authors, some by major authors working together. <br />Standard figures - the usurer, the prodigal, and the prostitute - and standard plots - notably intrigues based on money or sex (or both) - are traced to show the changes that occur in apparently stereotyped material at the hands of individual authors. The result is to display the range and internal variety of a genre that too often is seen as all of a piece, and to show the different ways in which social thinking can interact with the demands and comic form.<br />This book will interest students of Renaissance English drama, both for its treatment of a neglected type of play and for its comments on individual citizen comedies.

What are the discursive dynamics making a woman a whore? And, more importantly, what are the discursive mechanics of unmaking? In <i>Women and Shakespeare's Cuckoldry Plays: Shifting Narratives of Marital Betrayal</i>, Cristina Le\ufffdn Alfar pursues these questions to tease out familiar cultural stories about female sexuality that recur in the form of a slander narrative throughout William Shakespeare's work. She argues that the plays stage a structure of accusation and defense that unravels the authority of husbands to make and unmake wives. While men's accusations are built on a foundation of political, religious, legal, and domestic discourses about men's superiority to, and rule over, women, whose weaker natures render them perpetually suspect, women's bonds with other women animate defenses of virtue and obedience, fidelity and love, work loose the fabric of patrilineal power that undergirds masculine privileges in marriage, and signify a discursive shift that constitutes the site of agency within a system of oppression that ought to prohibit such agency. That women's agency in the early modern period <i>must </i>be tied to the formations of power that officially demand their subjection need not undermine their acts. In what Alfar calls Shakespeare's cuckoldry plays, women's rhetoric of defense is both subject to the discourse of sexual honor and finds a ground on which to \"shift it\" as women take control of and replace sexual slander with their own narratives of marital betrayal.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "476361", "name": "Cristina Leon Alfar", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/476361.Cristina_Leon_Alfar", "average_rating": "3.80", "ratings_count": "5", "text_reviews_count": "0"}}, "published": "2017", "work": {"id": "50939914", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Qsrm7uID7er8_U9_rzxUyg"}}]}}}}, "599681": {"GoodreadsResponse": {"Request": {"authentication": "true", "key": "9ri8jiLcNvV2GMvk5HVidg", "method": "author_show"}, "author": {"id": "599681", "name": "Derek Cohen", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/599681.Derek_Cohen", "fans_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1"}, "author_followers_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1"}, "large_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_333x500-46491541e26dbeac15f51487d68dd207.png", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png", "about": null, "influences": null, "works_count": "9", "gender": null, "hometown": null, "born_at": null, "died_at": null, "goodreads_author": null, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "23033910"}, "isbn": "0230379443", "isbn13": "9780230379442", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.CecaZVTFG-c3dXMKmD1Hjg", "title": "Shakespeare's Culture of Violence", "title_without_series": "Shakespeare's Culture of Violence", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23033910-shakespeare-s-culture-of-violence", "num_pages": "161", "format": "Unknown Binding", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Not Avail", "publication_day": "14", "publication_year": "2014", "publication_month": "5", "average_rating": "4.00", "ratings_count": "2", "description": "In this book, Derek Cohen studies the relationship of Shakespearean drama to the Western culture of violence.

All representations of the Jew in Christian culture are constructed in the light of this irreducible definition.\" -- from the introduction In a collection of insightful critical essays, Derek Cohen, Deborah Heller, and the contributing authors explore the different ways in which writers of English literature have amplified, varied, or denied this archetypical perception. While the authors approach this subject from diverse perspectives, the essays are unified by an awareness of the common tradition out of which representations of Jews have developed and illustrate the tradition's continuity and modifications. Studying the works of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Dickens, Trollope, George Eliot, Joyce, and a selection of texts from the ninth to the sixteenth century, the essays show how constructs of Jewishness fit into a writer's pre-existing concerns and patterns of representation and how even later, more favourable depictions are over-simplified reactions to this attitude. Some of the authors directly address the question of what constitutes anti-semitism in a literary work. All take into account the social and historical contexts in which the individual works took shape. Their main concern, however, is not to produce a social history but to illustrate how even the greatest writers draw on stereotypes embedded in the popular imagination and to focus on the internal dynamics of individual works, thereby recuperating classical portrayals within a contemporary critical perspective.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "599681", "name": "Derek Cohen", "role": "Editor", "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/599681.Derek_Cohen", "average_rating": "4.00", "ratings_count": "7", "text_reviews_count": "0"}}, "published": "1990", "work": {"id": "4402186", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.6rf0cAO_t75GKql3oeDveg"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "27616432"}, "isbn": "1505690676", "isbn13": "9781505690675", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.-XYT0lVCmBxylb31gidh_g", "title": "Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform in Texas: Fighting Contraband While Upholding Civil Liberties", "title_without_series": "Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform in Texas: Fighting Contraband While Upholding Civil Liberties", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27616432-civil-asset-forfeiture-reform-in-texas", "num_pages": "48", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Createspace", "publication_day": "24", "publication_year": "2014", "publication_month": "12", "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": "This monograph is an adapted transcript of a symposium that took place at the Texas Capitol on December 8, 2014.

Derek Cohen predicates his argument on the supposition that the individual, as much as the encompassing state, is subject to the shaping forces and machinery of the ideological surround. Shakespeare's plays, Cohen argues, consistently portray the clash between the passionate search for individuality and the quest for social harmony as irresolvable. The playwright's uncanny ability to carry the reader to the edge of imaginary experience far from the literal world that is made visible by the text offers an entry into the subtextual and ironic underside of the dramas. It is in this dark and strange world of slavery, mutilation, sexual jealousy, and suborned murder that the implicit political biases of the plays are most evident and it is here, too, that a modern political analysis reveals why Shakespeare portrayed the quest for individuation and self-expression as necessarily ending in tragedy.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "599681", "name": "Derek Cohen",

He was born in Cairo, Egypt, to non observant Jewish parents. He studied medicine (specialising in psychiatry) at Paris Medical School and worked at several hospitals. Then, in 1965, after having finished his training as a psychoanalyst, he became a member of the Paris Psychoanalytic Society (SPP), of which he was the president from 1986 to 1989. From 1975 to 1977 he was a vice president of the International Psychoanalytical Association and from 1979 to 1980 a professor at University College London.

It is ubiquitous but fleeting. Even silence has sound, even absence resonates. <i>Sound and the Ancient Senses</i> aims to hear the lost sounds of antiquity, from the sounds of the human body to those of the gods, from the bathhouse to the Forum, from the chirp of a cicada to the music of the spheres.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sound plays so great a role in shaping our environments as to make it a crucial sounding board for thinking about space and ecology, emotions and experience, mortality and the divine, orality and textuality, and the self and its connection to others. From antiquity to the present day, poets and philosophers have strained to hear the ways that sounds structure our world and identities.<br /><br /><br /><br />This volume looks at theories and practices of hearing and producing sounds in ritual contexts, medicine, mourning, music, poetry, drama, erotics, philosophy, rhetoric, linguistics, vocality, and on the page, and shows how ancient ideas of sound still shape how and what we hear today. As the first comprehensive introduction to the soundscapes of antiquity, this volume makes a significant contribution to the burgeoning fields of sound and voice studies and is the final volume of the series, <em>The Senses in Antiquity</em>.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "1379104", "name": "Shane Butler", "role": "Editor", "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1379104.Shane_Butler", "average_rating": "4.40", "ratings_count": "10", "text_reviews_count": "2"}}, "published": "2018", "work": {"id": "60804539", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.cBRrwTfqeLPh74JGrOwYQQ"}}]}}}}, "622628": {"GoodreadsResponse": {"Request": {"authentication": "true", "key": "9ri8jiLcNvV2GMvk5HVidg", "method": "author_show"}, "author": {"id": "622628", "name": "Corinne Ondine Pache", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/622628.Corinne_Ondine_Pache", "fans_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1"}, "author_followers_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1"}, "large_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_333x500-46491541e26dbeac15f51487d68dd207.png", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png", "about": null, "influences": null, "works_count": "5", "gender": null, "hometown": null, "born_at": null, "died_at": null, "goodreads_author": null, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1298583"}, "isbn": "0252029291", "isbn13": "9780252029295", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.rCAVyWF1--m2xC2utQ653A", "title": "Baby and Child Heroes in Ancient Greece", "title_without_series": "Baby and Child Heroes in Ancient Greece", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328871995m/1298583.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328871995s/1298583.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1298583.Baby_and_Child_Heroes_in_Ancient_Greece", "num_pages": "248", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "University of Illinois Press", "publication_day": "8", "publication_year": "2004", "publication_month": "12", "average_rating": "5.00", "ratings_count": "1", "description": "In addition to their famous gods and goddesses, the ancient Greeks also worshiped deceased human beings, including child and baby heroes. Although these heroes played an essential role in Greek religion, Corinne Ondine Pache's Baby and Child Heroes in Ancient Greece is the first systematic study of the considerable number of Greek babies and children who became enduring myths, objects of worship, and the recipients of sacrifice. Examining literary, pictorial, and numismatic representations, Pache opens up a vast territory once occupied by children such as Charila, Opheltes, Melikertes, and the children of Hercules and Medea. She elegantly argues that the stories, songs, and sanctuaries honoring these heroes express parental fears and guilt about children's death. Pache further demonstrates that while the myths and rituals articulate basic human anxieties, their emphasis is ultimately on the beauty that transcends the gruesomeness of the narrative, turning their dread into poetry. By showing the continuity of child heroes in Greek religion, she is able to throw new light on iconographies that have previously defied explanation.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "622628", "name": "Corinne Ondine Pache", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/622628.Corinne_Ondine_Pache", "average_rating": "4.37", "ratings_count": "19", "text_reviews_count": "2"}}, "published": "2004", "work": {"id": "1287745", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Zy-JNrO9SiSuTckJpDnyZQ"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "8369339"}, "isbn": "0195339363", "isbn13": "9780195339369", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.NqIoS6QqKDxNKctlmK9eTA", "title": "A Moment's Ornament: The Poetics of Nympholepsy in Ancient Greece", "title_without_series": "A Moment's Ornament: The Poetics of Nympholepsy in Ancient Greece", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8369339-a-moment-s-ornament", "num_pages": null, "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Oxford University Press Inc.

A Moment's Ornament examines the nympholepsy theme--the experience of being seized by a nymph or goddess--in ancient Greek cult &amp; poetry from the Archaic to the Hellenistic period. In poetry, this topos, which is ubiquitous in many of the most well-known ancient Greek sources, focuses on the figure of the goddess or nymph who falls in love with a man &amp; bears a mortal child. The theme also finds its way in ritual as stories of encounters between divinities &amp; men give rise to sanctuaries centering on nymphs &amp; nympholepts. Beyond the individual dimension of the nympholeptic experience, these narratives are also integrated within the community thru both poetry &amp; shrines. Nympholeptic narratives thus articulate key elements of the bond between mortals &amp; immortals &amp; the connection between myth &amp; ritual in ancient Greece. Both the cave sanctuaries founded by ancient nympholepts &amp; the poets' narratives of love between goddesses &amp; their mortal lovers function as \"a moment's ornament\" by preserving the memory of an encounter with the otherworldly at the intersection between myth &amp; cult.<br />Nympholeptic goddesses at the end of the theogony<br />Nympholepts in ancient Greece <br />Goddesses in love &amp; nympholeptic heroes<br />Odysseus nympholeptos <br />Kephalos in the city <br />Hellenistic nympholeptoi", "authors": {"author": {"id": "622628", "name": "Corinne Ondine Pache", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/622628.Corinne_Ondine_Pache", "average_rating": "4.37", "ratings_count": "19", "text_reviews_count": "2"}}, "published": null, "work": {"id": "13224695", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.hwkG0G3u4wjUlFUw06AkLg"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "373536"}, "isbn": "1890951099", "isbn13": "9781890951092", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "2"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.k4gB9L8PH__bo1wdUKQ_Pw", "title": "The Divided City: On Memory and Forgetting in Ancient Athens", "title_without_series": "The Divided City: On Memory and Forgetting in Ancient Athens", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/373536.The_Divided_City", "num_pages": "358", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Zone Books (NY)", "publication_day": "17", "publication_year": "2006", "publication_month": "3", "average_rating": "4.14", "ratings_count": "14", "description": "Athens, 403 B.C.E. The bloody oligarchic dictatorship of the Thirty is over, and the democrats have returned to the city victorious. Renouncing vengeance, in an act of willful amnesia, citizens call for -- -if not invent -- -amnesty. They agree to forget the unforgettable, the -past misfortunes, - of civil strife or stasis. More precisely, what they agree to deny is that stasis -- -simultaneously partisanship, faction, and sedition -- -is at the heart of their politics.Continuing a criticism of Athenian ideology begun in her pathbreaking study The Invention of Athens, Nicole Loraux argues that this crucial moment of Athenian political history must be interpreted as constitutive of politics and political life and not as a threat to it. Divided from within, the city is formed by that which it refuses. Conflict, the calamity of civil war, is the other, dark side of the beautiful unitary city of Athens. In a brilliant analysis of the Greek word for voting, diaphora, Loraux underscores the conflictual and dynamic motion of democratic life. Voting appears as the process of dividing up, of disagreement -- -in short, of agreeing to divide and choose. Not only does Loraux reconceptualize the definition of ancient Greek democracy, she also allows the contemporary reader to rethink the functioning of modern democracy in its critical moments of internal stasis.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "213011", "name": "Nicole Loraux", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/213011.Nicole_Loraux", "average_rating": "4.00", "ratings_count": "171", "text_reviews_count": "11"}}, "published": "2006", "work": {"id": "363448", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ySm0kdqX1G3aQgsdM7bHyQ"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "6639127"}, "isbn": "0300154720", "isbn13": "9780300154726", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.hG59mOvAhHXHnbQc5xH0Ew", "title": "Heroes: Mortals and Myths in Ancient Greece", "title_without_series": "Heroes: Mortals and Myths in Ancient Greece", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328827034m/6639127.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328827034s/6639127.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6639127-heroes", "num_pages": "328", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Walters Art Museum", "publication_day": "6", "publication_year": "2009", "publication_month": "10", "average_rating": "5.00", "ratings_count": "4", "description": "This handsome volume explores the integral role of heroes in ancient Greek art and culture.

Making space in the legal regime to take account of the role of non-State actors is one of the biggest and most critical challenges facing international law today.<br />", "authors": {"author": {"id": "158539", "name": "Philip Alston", "role": "Editor", "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/158539.Philip_Alston", "average_rating": "3.66", "ratings_count": "116", "text_reviews_count": "8"}}, "published": "2005", "work": {"id": "312050", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.OamguP3srD1OQsjIsp2bIw"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "321320"}, "isbn": "9024730872", "isbn13": "9789024730872", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.lIDtgDFqd3v1kdVvePMY8g", "title": "The Right To Food", "title_without_series": "The Right To Food", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/321320.The_Right_To_Food", "num_pages": "228", "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": "12", "publication_year": "1984", "publication_month": "11", "average_rating": "3.67", "ratings_count": "3", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "158539", "name": "Philip Alston", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/158539.Philip_Alston", "average_rating": "3.66", "ratings_count": "116", "text_reviews_count": "8"}}, "published": "1984", "work": {"id": "312052", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.hSYT_DCqnPDwQy2vmLmE8Q"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "5917958"}, "isbn": "019955272X", "isbn13": "9780199552726", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.1BXtZ7BD99vDHqA9Q91CYw", "title": "Human Rights, Intervention, and the Use of Force", "title_without_series": "Human Rights, Intervention, and the Use of Force", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5917958-human-rights-intervention-and-the-use-of-force", "num_pages": "294", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "OUP Oxford", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "2008", "publication_month": "12", "average_rating": "4.00", "ratings_count": "2", "description": "The imperatives of sovereignty, human rights and national security very often pull in different directions, yet the relations between these three different notions are considerably more subtle than those of simple opposition.

The chapters in this volume represent an attempt to face up to these dilemmas in all of their complexity, and to suggest ways in which they can be confronted productively both in the abstract and in the concrete circumstances of particular cases. <br /><br />", "authors": {"author": {"id": "158539", "name": "Philip Alston", "role": "Editor", "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/158539.Philip_Alston", "average_rating": "3.66", "ratings_count": "116", "text_reviews_count": "8"}}, "published": "2008", "work": {"id": "6090336", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.glsBn98UIP7MDdKTlf2bGQ"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "26261276"}, "isbn": "0190239484", "isbn13": "9780190239480", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.4TJV-FQzb72t5zD6Mm3SLA", "title": "The Transformation of Human Rights Fact-Finding", "title_without_series": "The Transformation of Human Rights Fact-Finding", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1445790125m/26261276.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1445790125s/26261276.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26261276-the-transformation-of-human-rights-fact-finding", "num_pages": "564", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "publication_day": "21", "publication_year": "2015", "publication_month": "12", "average_rating": "3.50", "ratings_count": "2", "description": "Fact-finding is at the heart of human rights advocacy, and is often at the center of international controversies about alleged government abuses. In recent years, human rights fact-finding has greatly proliferated and become more sophisticated and complex, while also being subjected to stronger scrutiny from governments. Nevertheless, despite the prominence of fact-finding, it remains strikingly under-studied and under-theorized. Too little has been done to bring forth the assumptions, methodologies, and techniques of this rapidly developing field, or to open human rights fact-finding to critical and constructive scrutiny.<br /><br /><em>The Transformation of Human Rights Fact-Finding</em> offers a multidisciplinary approach to the study of fact-finding with rigorous and critical analysis of the field of practice, while providing a range of accounts of what actually happens. It deepens the study and practice of human rights investigations, and fosters fact-finding as a discretely studied topic, while mapping crucial transformations in the field. The contributions to this book are the result of a major international conference organized by New York University Law School's Center for Human Rights and Global Justice. Engaging the expertise and experience of the editors and contributing authors, it offers a broad approach encompassing contemporary issues and analysis across the human rights spectrum in law, international relations, and critical theory. This book addresses the major areas of human rights fact-finding such as victim and witness issues; fact-finding for advocacy, enforcement, and litigation; the role of interdisciplinary expertise and methodologies; crowd sourcing, social media, and big data; and international guidelines for fact-finding.<br />", "authors": {"author": {"id": "158539", "name": "Philip Alston", "role": "Editor", "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/158539.Philip_Alston", "average_rating": "3.66", "ratings_count": "116", "text_reviews_count": "8"}}, "published": "2015", "work": {"id": "46260382", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Tu92L8tAxRjpulNDafXKQQ"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "2575655"}, "isbn": "0199243654", "isbn13": "9780199243655", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.FRsEZIfX9zjpGFC87PAf3w", "title": "People's Rights", "title_without_series": "People's Rights", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1417981853m/2575655.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1417981853s/2575655.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2575655-people-s-rights", "num_pages": "360", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "OUP Oxford", "publication_day": "4", "publication_year": "2001", "publication_month": "10", "average_rating": "2.33", "ratings_count": "3", "description": "The right to self-determination has been a driving force in international law and politics through much of the post-World War II period.

Does learning to read and write change children's speech, thought or orientation to language? What are children and adults learning when they acquire literate skills?

Child welfare systems attempt to balance the needs of the child and those of the parents, often failing both. Clearly answering this question is the most important, yet unaddressed, issue facing the child welfare system.<br />- <strong>Decisions</strong>. The key task for a caseworker is not to provide services but to make decisions regarding child abuse and neglect, case goals, and placement; however, practitioners have only the crudest tools at their disposal when making what are literally life and death decisions.<br />- <strong>The Perverse Incentive</strong>. Billions of dollars are spent each year to place and maintain children in out-of-home care. Foster care is meant to be short-term, yet the existing federal funding serves as a perverse incentive to keep children in out-of-home placements.<br />- <strong>Aging out</strong>. More than 20,000 youth age out of the foster care system each year, and yet what the system calls \"emancipation\" could more accurately be viewed as child neglect. After having spent months, years, or longer moving from placement to placement, aging-out youth are suddenly thrust into homelessness, unemployment, welfare, and oppressive disadvantage. <br />The chapters in this book offer a blueprint for reform that eschews the tired cycle of a tragedy followed by outrage and calls for more money, staff, training, and lawsuits that provide, at best, fleeting relief as a new complacency slowly sets in until the cycle repeats.

Early in his career, he also produced a temperance novel, Franklin Evans (1842).<br /><br />After working as clerk, teacher, journalist and laborer, Whitman wrote his masterpiece, Leaves of Grass, pioneering free verse poetry in a humanistic celebration of humanity, in 1855. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12080.Emerson\" title=\"Emerson\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emerson</a>, whom Whitman revered, said of Leaves of Grass that it held \"incomparable things incomparably said.\" During the Civil War, Whitman worked as an army nurse, later writing Drum Taps (1865) and Memoranda During the War (1867). His health compromised by the experience, he was given work at the Treasury Department in Washington, D.C. After a stroke in 1873, which left him partially paralyzed, Whitman lived his next 20 years with his brother, writing mainly prose, such as Democratic Vistas (1870). Leaves of Grass was published in nine editions, with Whitman elaborating on it in each successive edition. In 1881, the book had the compliment of being banned by the commonwealth of Massachusetts on charges of immorality. A good friend of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/156323.Robert_Ingersoll\" title=\"Robert Ingersoll\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Ingersoll</a>, Whitman was at most a Deist who scorned religion.

Focusing in particular on testimonial narrative, from slave narrative in the late eighteenth century to contemporary Anglophone life narrative from Africa, Australia, the Caribbean, Palestine, North America, and India, this study follows texts on the move through adaptation, appropriation, and remediation. For postcolonial subjects life narrative offers extraordinary opportunities to present accounts of social injustice and oppression, of violence and social suffering. Testimonial narrative can reach across cultures to produce intimate attachments between those who testify and those who bear witness to legacies of apartheid, slavery, rape warfare, genocide, and dispossession. Thresholds of testimony are subject to change and for some, for example refugees and asylum seekers, opportunities to engage a witnessing public and inspire campaigns for social justice on their behalf are curtailed--these are the 'ends of testimony'. The production, circulation, and reception of testimonial life narrative connects directly to the most fundamental questions of who counts as human, what rights follow from this, and what makes for grievable life. Postcolonial life narrative is a dynamic field of literature and criticism, and this book presents a series of proximate readings that outline its distinctive imaginative geographies.<br />", "authors": {"author": {"id": "445776", "name": "Gillian Whitlock", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/445776.Gillian_Whitlock", "average_rating": "3.94", "ratings_count": "17", "text_reviews_count": "1"}}, "published": "2015", "work": {"id": "43220515", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.poIPPGIwn_SKuI_Z1FoVVw"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "2703315"}, "isbn": "0702224472", "isbn13": "9780702224478", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.oJ-_ufPf9-d7hgV7xcsMPg", "title": "Images of Australia: An Introductory Reader in Australian Studies", "title_without_series": "Images of Australia: An Introductory Reader in Australian Studies", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2703315-images-of-australia", "num_pages": "268", "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "4.00", "ratings_count": "2", "description": "This collection of readings offers an introductory guide to Australian Studies.

Unlike previous studies of autobiography which focus on a limited Euro American canon, the book brings together contemporary and 19th-century women's autobiographies and travel writing from Canada, the Caribbean, Kenya, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

The contexts and media of these autobiographical trauma texts are diverse, yet they are linked by attention to questions of who gets to speak/write/inscribe autobiographically and how and where and why, and how can silences in the wake of traumatic experiences be read. These essays deliberately set out to establish some new fields for research in trauma studies by reaching out to a broader global context, into various texts, media and artifacts, representing diverse histories with specific attention to different voices, bodies, memories and subjectivities. This collection addresses the contemporary circuits of trauma story, and the media and icons and narratives that carry trauma story to political effect and emotional affect.<br /><br />This book was

church, with God, with all of it. But to find the girl, he has to go back.\"</strong><br /><br />In Mark Haines's former life, he was an evangelical youth pastor, a role model, and a family man--until he abandoned his wife, his daughter, and his beliefs. Now he's marking time between sunny days surfing and dark nights working security at an industrial complex. His isolation is broken when Cindy, a charming twenty-two-year old drifter he sees hitchhiking on the Pacific Coast Highway, hustles him for a breakfast and a place to crash--two cynical kindred spirits.<br /><br />Then his co-worker is murdered in a robbery gone wrong and Cindy disappears on the same night. Haines knows he should let it go and return to his safe life of solitude. Instead, he's driven to find out where Cindy went, under stranger and stranger circumstances. Soon Mark is chasing leads, each one taking him back into a world where his old life came crashing down--into the seedier side of southern California's drug trade and ultimately into the secrets of an Evangelical megachurch where his past and his future are about to converge. What begins as an investigation becomes a haunting mystery and a psychological journey both for Mark, and for the elusive young stranger he won't let get away.<br /><br />Set in the early 2000s, <em>The Churchgoer</em> is a gripping noir, a quiet subversion of the genre, and a powerful meditation on belief, morality, and the nature of evil in contemporary life.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "292512", "name": "Patrick Coleman", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/292512.Patrick_Coleman", "average_rating": "3.65", "ratings_count": "4781", "text_reviews_count": "164"}}, "published": "2019", "work": {"id": "64198880", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.KhbV16fkHxNYCsEtU9oz6w"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "39809311"}, "isbn": "0773554858", "isbn13": "9780773554856", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.TkwlpPZIc0vjvOs0BtnaCA", "title": "Equivocal City: French and English Novels of Postwar Montreal", "title_without_series": "Equivocal City: French and English Novels of Postwar Montreal", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1523889019m/39809311.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1523889019s/39809311.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39809311-equivocal-city", "num_pages": "376", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "McGill-Queen's University Press", "publication_day": "30", "publication_year": "2018", "publication_month": "10", "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": "The study of Montreal as a specific location in French and English writings has long been subordinated to the demands of linguistically divided and politically contentious narratives about national development.

From the responsible realism of Hugh MacLennan and Gabrielle Roy to the fractious phantasmagorias of Jacques Ferron and Leonard Cohen, Equivocal City traces the evolution of the Montreal novel with the aim of retrieving a shareable literary past.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "292512", "name": "Patrick Coleman", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/292512.Patrick_Coleman", "average_rating": "3.65", "ratings_count": "4781", "text_reviews_count": "164"}}, "published": "2018", "work": {"id": "61566130", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.-OhYnMmSNoUZEAg4T5iJVA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "25246831"}, "isbn": "0300215479", "isbn13": "9780300215472", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "1"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.fJXPFvJ-gUJ15thClmkGsA", "title": "The Art of Music", "title_without_series": "The Art of Music", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25246831-the-art-of-music", "num_pages": "318", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Yale University Press", "publication_day": "27", "publication_year": "2015", "publication_month": "10", "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": "<b>A fascinating study of the relationship between music and visual art in a variety of media from around the world </b><br /><br /><i>The Art of Music</i> is a handsomely illustrated and rich interdisciplinary look at the mutual influence between music and the visual arts across cultures and eras.

Emotions are social transactions, with rules identifying when and where it is appropriate to express one's feelings and, especially in the case of anger and gratitude, who is allowed or expected to put them on display. Defining the kinds of slight or favor that demand an angry or a grateful response became problematic in eighteenth-century France under the pressure of two contradictory developments which were both crucial to Enlightenment thinking about sociability. The first drew on the ideal of moral equality as it spread beyond the salons to the social world at large. Writers claimed for themselves an entitlement to anger at personal slight that had been hitherto reserved for aristocrats, and a respectful hearing for their indignation at public injustice despite their lack of official standing. The <em>philosophes</em> also argued their writing made them social benefactors in their own right, more deserving of their readers' gratitude than obliged to any patron. The second gave a new twist to longstanding philosophical notions about transcending emotional disturbance and dependence altogether. A personal ideal became a public goal as Enlightenment thinkers imagined a society where all significant social interaction was governed by the impersonal rule of law. Occasions for personal slight or obligation would disappear, and with them reasons for anger and gratitude. Instead of serving as a model of emotional legitimacy, authors would derive their prestige from their rationality and objectivity. By exploring the interplay between these two attitudes toward anger and gratitude this book provides a fresh perspective on the French Enlightenment.<br />", "authors": {"author": {"id": "292512", "name": "Patrick Coleman", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/292512.Patrick_Coleman", "average_rating": "3.65", "ratings_count": "4781", "text_reviews_count": "164"}}, "published": "2011", "work": {"id": "15297226", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.WIEXqUcnL4ixW5RGTp429A"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "2882700"}, "isbn": "0521661463", "isbn13": "9780521661461", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.5p-LUf7ca6mA22BVYkQ4LA", "title": "Representations of the Self from the Renaissance to Romanticism", "title_without_series": "Representations of the Self from the Renaissance to Romanticism", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2882700-representations-of-the-self-from-the-renaissance-to-romanticism", "num_pages": "298", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "2015", "publication_month": "12", "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "description": "A team of international contributors explores the way modern conceptions of what constitutes an individual's life story emerged in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

Miller delivers!\" - Jeffrey Long, MD <br /> Reports of near-death experiences (NDEs) are flooding the media with books, articles and interviews. People describe hovering over their bodies, details of their surgeries, talking with deceased relatives, and reviewing their lives in vivid detail, often while their brains should be incapable of producing rational thought or memories. <br /> While the accounts are no doubt interesting, do they provide any solid evidence for the afterlife and the existence of God? Miller argues, in nontechnical and engaging prose, that it does indeed. He began his study doubting that NDEs provided such evidence, but found himself convinced by the weight of the evidence.<br /> In this multiple award-winning book, the reader will explore: <br /><br />The common naturalistic explanations for NDEs. Evidence that NDEs point to God and heaven. The results of 35 years of research into NDEs by doctors and other professionals, fully documented for those who want to study further. A comparison of NDEs with Christian teachings. Recommendations of key books, researchers, and publications for further study. <br /><br />\"Can we survive death? Is there a God or a heaven?

[N]o one can again look at the subject without at least a respectful nod in his direction.\" --Lamin Sanneh<br /><br />In Ghana's New Christianity, Paul Gifford considers the explosion of Christianity in sub-Saharan Africa by focusing on one place: Greater Accra, Ghana. Gifford examines every dimension of these new churches and mega-churches, including their discourse, theological vision, worship, rituals, music, media involvement, use of the Bible, finances, and clientele. Ghana's New Christianity sets religious devotion into Ghana's political and economic situation and focuses on how fervent belief in success and wealth in the here and now can provide motivation to change in circumstances where it is so easy to despair. No other book brings forth the complex nature of Africa's new Christianity with such clarity or offers such a searching analysis of its power to tackle Africa's predicament.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "163347", "name": "Paul Gifford", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/163347.Paul_Gifford", "average_rating": "3.55", "ratings_count": "29", "text_reviews_count": "4"}}, "published": "2004", "work": {"id": "2312038", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.mgHSX7ybgHeHV49EFwBH-g"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "12473656"}, "isbn": "0852614489", "isbn13": "9780852614488", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.A6zb468EauP5CCGCVGI-Ig", "title": "Valery: Charmes", "title_without_series": "Valery: Charmes", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12473656-valery", "num_pages": null, "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "3.40", "ratings_count": "5", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "163347", "name": "Paul Gifford", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/163347.Paul_Gifford", "average_rating": "3.55", "ratings_count": "29", "text_reviews_count": "4"}}, "published": null, "work": {"id": "17457861", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.mcXmTPi9MXRT3p_3bCuBow"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "6376209"}, "isbn": "0231154429", "isbn13": "9780231154420", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.2zC_sDEIhkTazwmpOYmFng", "title": "Christianity, Politics, and Public Life in Kenya", "title_without_series": "Christianity, Politics, and Public Life in Kenya", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355132506m/6376209.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355132506s/6376209.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6376209-christianity-politics-and-public-life-in-kenya", "num_pages": "283", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Columbia University Press", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "2009", "publication_month": "10", "average_rating": "3.75", "ratings_count": "4", "description": "Since achieving independence in 1963, Kenya has existed as a classic, patronage state, ruled with an iron fist by a corrupt political elite. Kenya has also become nearly 80 percent Christian, and in this book, Paul Gifford explores the country's diverse churches and their role in shaping public and political life.<br /><br />During the 1990s, Kenya's Catholic and Protestant churches challenged the state's dysfunctional one-party rule; yet today these organizations are interested more in increasing the numbers of their missionaries and enlarging their global networks than in protesting the current regime. Gifford follows this historical shift, noting the specific theology of Kenya's churches, which deeply respect African culture as a non-negotiable component of African Christianity. He also covers the rich variety of Kenya's churches and their individual efforts to preserve Kenyan cultures.<br /><br />Countless Pentecostal churches have also emerged in recent decades, ranging from affluent middle-class institutions to shelters for the poor. Nearly all emphasize power, success, achievement, and prosperity, priorities that privilege modernity over tradition. Gifford discusses the influence of these churches on domestic media; their crusades, structure, and use of scripture; and their complex economics, which help to explain the thorough domestication of Kenyan Christianity in recent decades, reinforcing the country's corrupt political practices.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "163347", "name": "Paul Gifford", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/163347.Paul_Gifford", "average_rating": "3.55", "ratings_count": "29", "text_reviews_count": "4"}}, "published": "2009", "work": {"id": "6563888", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.RoDESL4NnYkHsDjx7AP1yg"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "280782"}, "isbn": "0253212049", "isbn13": "9780253212047", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.ZRdZDVF9oAsPECnrIjuaYQ", "title": "African Christianity: Its Public Role", "title_without_series": "African Christianity: Its Public Role", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1383166368m/280782.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1383166368s/280782.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/280782.African_Christianity", "num_pages": "384", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Indiana University Press", "publication_day": "22", "publication_year": "1998", "publication_month": "7", "average_rating": "3.00", "ratings_count": "3", "description": "This is by far the most informative book about contemporary African Christianity around; nobody could have written a study as richly detailed and as informed by real insider knowledge as he has done....

An interesting, important critical assessment of the extent to which the churches are playing a major role in the emergence of a civil society.... Gifford's overall analysis and his four case studies are so fresh and so important that... they cry out for immediate publication.\" --Richard Gray<br /><br />Paul Gifford analyzes African Christianity in the mid-1990s, against the background of the continent's current social, economic, and political circumstances. Gifford employs concepts taken from political economy to shed light on the current dynamics of African churches and churchgoers and assesses their different contributions to political developments since 1989. He also evaluates the churches' role in promoting a civil society in Africa. Four case studies--Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, and Cameroon--cover all strands of Christianity: Catholic, Evangelical, mainline Protestant, Pentecostal, and Independent.

Paul Gifford's book allows this considerable contemporary phenomenon to be observed steadily and whole, with strategic understanding of its origins, nature and meaning. Gifford paints a clear and coherent picture of the evolution of erotic ideas and their imaginary and formal expressions in modern French writing. He first retraces the formative matrix of French tradition by engaging with five classic sources: Plato's Symposium, the Song of Songs, the myth of Genesis, the tension between Greek Eros and Christian Agape and the repercussions of Nietzsche's declaration of the 'death of God'. Modern variations on these perennial problematics are then pursued in ten chapters devoted to Proust, Val\ufffdry, Claudel, Breton, Bataille, Duras, Barthes, Irigarary, Emmanuel, Kristeva. Literary and theoretical perspectives are perfectly blended in his study of these attempts at 'deciphering Eros'. The book will appeal not only to students of French literature, but to all those interested in the cultural upheavals of the twentieth century.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "163347", "name": "Paul Gifford", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/163347.Paul_Gifford", "average_rating": "3.55", "ratings_count": "29", "text_reviews_count": "4"}}, "published": "2006", "work": {"id": "3443685", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.-6owByWBjYl2FrxGIgO83A"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "25564846"}, "isbn": {"@nil": "true"}, "isbn13": {"@nil": "true"}, "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.vZt1GcG9Elha3kuJIN76OQ", "title": "Pirate Ship Playhouse Plans: Step by step illustrated guide for building the \"Paulsplayhouses.com\" pirate ship playhouse", "title_without_series": "Pirate Ship Playhouse Plans: Step by step illustrated guide for building the \"Paulsplayhouses.com\" pirate ship playhouse", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25564846-pirate-ship-playhouse-plans", "num_pages": null, "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": null, "publication_day": null, "publication_year": null, "publication_month": null, "average_rating": "5.00", "ratings_count": "1", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "163347", "name": "Paul Gifford", "role": "Illustrator", "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/163347.Paul_Gifford", "average_rating": "3.55", "ratings_count": "29", "text_reviews_count": "4"}}, "published": null, "work": {"id": "45362971", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ow1QgyBMPJfinpnnw5zpPA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "17989323"}, "isbn": "1139238795", "isbn13": "9781139238793", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.gS5nEYK1-zBN0Nd0sm3plQ", "title": "Reading Paul Val\ufffdry: Universe in Mind", "title_without_series": "Reading Paul Val\ufffdry: Universe in Mind", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "small_image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17989323-reading-paul-val-ry", "num_pages": null, "format": "ebook", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publication_day": "11", "publication_year": "2012", "publication_month": "5", "average_rating": "4.00", "ratings_count": "1", "description": "The most recently acknowledged--and the most private--of the masters of modernity, Paul Valery is perhaps the most radical and wide-ranging.

Churches catering for this worldview lay bare the workings of this spirit world, and this enchanted imagination, along with the prosperity gospel, and emphasis on the pastor's \"anointing,\" are the principal characteristics of much African Pentecostalism. <br />Gifford argues that the enchanted religious imagination militates against development by encouraging fear and distrust, diminishing human responsibility and agency, and downplaying functional rationality.

Postcolonial theory has been challenged on several fronts: on its interdisciplinary competence, on the politics of its institutional location, and its implicit will to have power over other kinds of postcolonial analysis, many of which have been established for much longer than postcolonial theory itself. The ensuing debate has often become so heated, even personalized, that the issues at stake have been obscured.<br /><br />In what is the most comprehensive and accessible survey of the field to date, Bart Moore-Gilbert systematically examines the objections that have been raised against postcolonial theory, revealing the simplifications and exaggerations on both sides of the argument. He provides a detailed institutional history of the ways in which the relationship between culture and colonialism was traditionally studied in the West, then traces the emergence of alternative forms of postcolonial analysis of such questions. He gives an extremely careful presentation of the complex and elusive work of the three principal representatives of postcolonial theory, Gayatri Spivak, Edward Said and Homi Bhabha, and considers the criticisms they have faced, from an alleged Eurocentrism to an obfuscatory prose style. And he assesses the overlaps and differences between postcolonial theory and other forms of postcolonial criticism. Finally he considers the ways in which postcolonial analysis may be connected with different histories of oppression, and looks at how such a heterogeneous theory can be reconciled with political questions of solidarity and alliance in the continuing struggle for cultural decolonization.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "13083", "name": "Bart Moore-Gilbert", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13083.Bart_Moore_Gilbert", "average_rating": "3.43", "ratings_count": "53", "text_reviews_count": "13"}}, "published": "1997", "work": {"id": "1853753", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.IgUhK0LoKpP4FGrX5oyztg"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "860887"}, "isbn": "058223798X", "isbn13": "9780582237988", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.U-PsxeMy1ysqwY9eyFo-2A", "title": "Postcolonial Criticism", "title_without_series": "Postcolonial Criticism", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1393225210m/860887.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1393225210s/860887.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/860887.Postcolonial_Criticism", "num_pages": "301", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Routledge", "publication_day": "3", "publication_year": "1997", "publication_month": "10", "average_rating": "3.86", "ratings_count": "7", "description": "Post-colonial theory is a relatively new area in critical contemporary studies, having its foundations more Postcolonial Criticism brings together some of the most important critical writings in the field, and aims to present a clear overview of, and introduction to, one of the most exciting and rapidly developing areas of contemporary literary criticism. It charts the development of the field both historically and conceptually, from its beginnings in the early post-war period to the present day.<br /><br />The first phase of postcolonial criticism is recorded here in the pioneering work of thinkers like Aim\ufffd C\ufffdsaire, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, and Gayatri Spivak. More recently, a new generation of academics have provided fresh assessments of the interaction of class, race and gender in cultural production, and this generation is represented in the work of Aijaz Ahmad, bell hooks, Homi Bhabha, Abdul JanMohamed and David Lloyd. Topics covered include negritude, national culture, orientalism, subalternity, ambivalence, hybridity, white settler societies, gender and colonialism, culturalism, commonwealth literature, and minority discourse.<br /><br />The collection includes an extensive general introduction which clearly sets out the key stages, figures and debates in the field. The editors point to the variety, even conflict, within the field, but also stress connections and parallels between the various figures and debates which they identify as central to an understanding of it. The introduction is followed by a series of ten essays which have been carefully chosen to reflect both the diversity and continuity of postcolonial criticism. Each essay is supported by a short introduction which places it in context with the rest of the author's work, and identifies how its salient arguments contribute to the field as a whole.<br /><br />This is a field which covers many disciplines including literary theory, cultural studies, philosophy, geography, economics, history and politics. It is designed to fit into the current modular arrangement of courses, and is therefore suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate courses which address postcolonial issues and the 'new' literatures in English.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "13083", "name": "Bart Moore-Gilbert", "role": "Editor", "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13083.Bart_Moore_Gilbert", "average_rating": "3.43", "ratings_count": "53", "text_reviews_count": "13"}}, "published": "1997", "work": {"id": "846326", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.nrMjB9Qn2TqB3LDGerVjsA"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "9878406"}, "isbn": "0415442990", "isbn13": "9780415442992", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.HJiBewWIwDv7zoayhRNcPA", "title": "Postcolonial Life-Writing: Culture, Politics, and Self-Representation", "title_without_series": "Postcolonial Life-Writing: Culture, Politics, and Self-Representation", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1292032906m/9878406.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1292032906s/9878406.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9878406-postcolonial-life-writing", "num_pages": "174", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Routledge", "publication_day": "1", "publication_year": "2009", "publication_month": "6", "average_rating": "3.67", "ratings_count": "3", "description": "Postcolonial Life-Writing is the first attempt to offer a sustained critique of this increasingly visible and influential field of cultural production.<br /><br />Bart Moore-Gilbert considers the relationship between postcolonial life-writing and its western analogues, identifying the key characteristics that differentiate the genre in the postcolonial context.

In The Twentieth Century, Robert P. Morgan helps us grasp the flavor of the era by presenting forty-five readings from the period, nearly all written by active participants in the musical developments of the time. Thus we tune in to the voices of some thirty composers-from Busoni to Babbitt, Ives to Xenakis, Satie to Stravinsky-and learn from performers Anderson and Landowska, philosopher-critics Adorno, Dahlhaus, and Meyer, and writers Cocteau, Barthes, and Eco.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "3320734", "name": "Robert   Morgan", "role": "Editor", "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text":

been the evolution of a new style or movement but in how art is promoted and marketed. After prices accelerated in the 1980s, today's art world is beginning to look more like a multi-national corporation than a cultural institution.<br /><br />Acclaimed critic, poet, and historian Robert C. Morgan argues for a new qualitative standard in art, not only in painting and sculpture, but also in literature, music, video, photography, conceptual art, and installations. Poignantly and powerfully written, he calls for an end to the art world as we know it, a world governed by the trends of fashion, media, and popular entertainment, and proposes a return to aesthetics and a new inner-directedness in art.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "3320734", "name": "Robert   Morgan", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3320734.Robert_Morgan", "average_rating": "4.09", "ratings_count": "381", "text_reviews_count": "31"}}, "published": "1998", "work": {"id": "655015", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.KmsGcuRkx1mA5Y4bn_BC7Q"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "2749033"}, "isbn": "0334011043", "isbn13": "9780334011040", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.sF6RBdBji18XRBDIA9TpNA", "title": "The Nature Of New Testament Theology; The Contribution Of William Wrede And Adolf Schlatter", "title_without_series": "The Nature Of New Testament Theology; The Contribution Of William Wrede And Adolf Schlatter", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1381288529m/2749033.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1381288529s/2749033.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2749033-the-nature-of-new-testament-theology-the-contribution-of-william-wrede", "num_pages": "196", "format": null, "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Scm-Canterbury Press", "publication_day": "11", "publication_year": "2012", "publication_month": "6", "average_rating": "3.60", "ratings_count": "5", "description": null, "authors": {"author": {"id": "3320734", "name": "Robert   Morgan", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3320734.Robert_Morgan", "average_rating": "4.09", "ratings_count": "381", "text_reviews_count": "31"}}, "published": "2012", "work": {"id": "2774715", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.l6l23sfL9zFg2TrrQFcBnQ"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "2016265"}, "isbn": "0192132571", "isbn13": "9780192132574", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "0"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.lSjhW6fduIAZtO8VYOi16w", "title": "Biblical Interpretation", "title_without_series": "Biblical Interpretation", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1420789687m/2016265.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1420789687s/2016265.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2016265.Biblical_Interpretation", "num_pages": "352", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": null, "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "publication_day": "17", "publication_year": "1988", "publication_month": "11", "average_rating": "3.00", "ratings_count": "2", "description": "This book defines interpretation and examines the special issues that surround biblical interpretation.

The family fortunes were based on coal-mining. In her enthralling memoirs she told of her aristocratic upbringing with an increasingly eccentric father, a Conservative MP with strong liberal leanings, and a mother who died young from cancer. Her personal account of marrying Mark Birley at 20, the creation of Annabel's Club in Berkeley Square, and then her affair and later marriage to entrepreneur Sir James Goldsmith, enthralled many readers. The club was a huge success from the beginning and remains so into its fourth decade. Annabel had three children with Goldsmith, including Jemima, Zac and, Ben, who married into the Rothschild family. But tragedy was never far away: Rupert, her eldest son, died in an accident, and Goldsmith died from cancer after financing a campaign of candidates opposed to the John Major line on the EU at the 1997 general election. This book elegantly describes, in intimate and perceptive essays, pen-portraits of some of the extraordinary figures that entered the Birley and Goldsmith circles\u2014among them, Lord Lambton, Patrick Plunket, John Aspinall, Geoffrey Keating, Lord Lucan, Dominic Elwes and Claus von Bulow.

Whether writing short stories, learning to play music, or painting landscapes, the brain and psyche benefit. Ironically, lifestyle and natural changes in brain and hormonal functioning beyond age sixty actually facilitate mastery of the fine arts in ways that elude younger people.<br />\tDr. Toder\u2019s newest book delves into the latest brain science findings in everyday terms while also opening a window into the lives of more than twenty late-blooming artists who first took up the violin, memoir writing, or other artistic pursuits after they turned sixty. While some were motivated by curiosity, others desired to realize a previously unmet dream. Their stories inspire and validate Toder\u2019s findings.<br />\"The Vintage Years\" eBook includes in-depth interviews, research findings, end-notes, artist\u2019s photos and samples of interviewed writers\u2019 work.

The puzzles are grouped into four sections, with each group becoming increasingly more challenging. To assist reluctant readers, the words are in tables below the puzzles. More proficient readers may choose to cover the word tables, but it's still okay to peek once in awhile! Extra blank puzzles make it easier for siblings to share the book. Three sections have six puzzles; one has eight, for a total of 26 puzzles, including a few Find the Word puzzles. More than 50 short poems, nestled in otherwise blank spaces, provide additional enjoyment for children. Simple illustrations enhance the puzzles and poems. Most of the puzzles and poems in this book are either in the 5-book Reading Logically series, or in the supplementary reading and activity books (More Great Beginnings, More New Adventures, More Higher Skills). Because they are originally part of a reading program, the puzzles usually concentrate on a particular skill, such as \"o\" sounds like a short \"u,\" \"OW\" Crossword Puzzle, \"LE\" Crossword, and Homophone Puzzle. For the Texas families, four pages of Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) for English Language Arts and Reading list the TEKS that are supported by each section of Crossword Puzzles for Phonics and Fun.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "6033139", "name": "Mary Humpal Bain", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "true", "#text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6033139.Mary_Humpal_Bain", "average_rating": "0.0", "ratings_count": "0", "text_reviews_count": "0"}}, "published": "2016", "work": {"id": "53993855", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.DdelSyAC1A1KgbG2j-MUgw"}}]}}}}, "18064603": {"GoodreadsResponse": {"Request": {"authentication": "true", "key": "9ri8jiLcNvV2GMvk5HVidg", "method": "author_show"}, "author": {"id": "18064603", "name": "R.J.
