# 507 Final Project: Exploring Books and Authors of Different Genres

This program that lets the user browse through various book genres (ie Mystery, Action, Romance) and displays various analyses of the books. The Google Book API took in multiple genres (in this case, eighteen genres) and returned information about the indivudal book's title, author, ISBN, publisher, publish date, description and rating. From here, the ISBN was used in the GoodReads API, which requires API authenthication. Since the prevoius API returned two ISBN's, the more commonly used, thirteen digit, ISBN was plugged in as a paramter to the GoodReads API to return more information about the book. This call gave us the author ID, which is unique to every author on GoodReads. This time, the GoodReads API was utilized to query about the author and gave us information such as the author's hometown. After obtaining the hometown city, the Google Geocoding API was was utilized to get the latitude and longitude of the hometown.
